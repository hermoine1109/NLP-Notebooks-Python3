Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis."

For details on the algorithms below, see the word2vec API documentation as well as the Google documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Architecture: Architecture options are skip-gram (default) or continuous bag of words. We found that skip-gram was very slightly slower but produced better results.\n",
    "* Training algorithm: Hierarchical softmax (default) or negative sampling. For us, the default worked well.\n",
    "* Downsampling of frequent words: The Google documentation recommends values between .00001 and .001. For us, values closer 0.001 seemed to improve the accuracy of the final model.\n",
    "* Word vector dimensionality: More features result in longer runtimes, and often, but not always, result in better models. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds; we used 300.\n",
    "* Context / window size: How many words of context should the training algorithm take into account? 10 seems to work well for hierarchical softmax (more is better, up to a point).\n",
    "* Worker threads: Number of parallel processes to run. This is computer-specific, but between 4 and 6 should work on most systems.\n",
    "* Minimum word count: This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. In this case, since each movie occurs 30 times, we set the minimum word count to 40, to avoid attaching too much importance to individual movie titles. This resulted in an overall vocabulary size of around 15,000 words. Higher values also help limit run time."
