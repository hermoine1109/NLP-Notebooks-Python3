Lady Crane:
<i>My son.</i>

4
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,406
My firstborn son.

5
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:06,347
My child king, hush.

6
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,418
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

7
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,124
Fight no more, sweet child.

8
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,260
Your wars are won.

9
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:23,264
The wolves are buried

10
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,666
and the false stag done.

11
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,239
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

12
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,874
Let the crown fall.

13
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,577
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

14
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:41,515
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

15
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:49,890
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

16
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:52,726
and my brother the Imp

17
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:55,629
who killed his own king.

18
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:58,399
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

19
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,768
I will slay him, I swear.

20
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,437
With noose or with knife,

21
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,140

22
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:09,777

You're good at that.

Where did you learn?

41
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,271
I'm a jealous woman.

42
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,674
I've always liked bad men

43
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,876
and they've always liked me.

44
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:53,447
They'd come home wherever
home was that night

45
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:57,751
stinking of some whore's perfume.

46
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:00,688
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

47
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,524
And then I'd feel terrible,

48
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,592
so I'd patch them up.

49
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,094
<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

50
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,829
And good at putting holes in them.

51
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:11,165
(chuckles)
And that.

52
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:16,236
What happened to the actress?

53
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,440
<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

54
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,175
Bianca.

55
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,811
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

56
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,946
after what I did to her face.

57
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:31,085
(slurps)

58
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,386
Mmm.

59
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:34,555
I never did learn to cook.

60
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,224
But eat.
Eat. You need it.

61
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:42,196
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

62
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,831
You should come with us.

63
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,966
- I can't.
- Why not?

64
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:48,502
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

65
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:50,671
And besides, we need a new actress.

66
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:54,508
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

67
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,010
Come with us.

68
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,079
What's left for you here?

69
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:03,016
You wouldn't be safe.

70
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,919
Not while she's looking for me.

71
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,155
<i>Who?</i>

72
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:09,823
She doesn't have a name.

73
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,064
Where will you go?

74
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:23,437
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

75
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,506
But what's west of Westeros?

76
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:27,975
I don't know.

77
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:29,643
Nobody does.

78
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,845
<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

79
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,881
The edge of the world, maybe.

80
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,282
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

81

82
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,362
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

83
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:50,030
I don't want any.

84
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:55,335
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

85
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:59,273
Trust me, if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.

Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

89
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,420
I was a famous kisser.

90
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:49,089
You lads know how to kiss proper?

91
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:52,259
Course we do.

92
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,895
This is for masters, this technique.

93
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,830
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

94
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,333
He says he's ready.

95
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:02,436
All right.
Now, pay attention.

96
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:08,542
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

97
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:11,945
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

98
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:14,448
Very romantic.

99
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,551
Take your middle finger, yeah,

100
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:19,753
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

101
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:22,656

102
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:24,157
<i>So fucking close!</i>

103
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,894
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

104
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,595
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

105
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:31,765

If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.

If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

138
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,480
We need friends in Westeros.

And we need ships.

140
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,783
Most of all, we need our queen.

She'll come back.
She has to.

I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

Have been permitted?

That's rather a tortured

They demand to see you, Your Grace.

Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:24,397
The High Septon commands you.

166
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,600
<i>Are you sure you want to refuse him?</i>

167
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:32,005
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

168
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:34,040
He made no such promises.

169
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,166
If you refuse to come of your
own free will--

170
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,407
Get out.

171
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:48,822
Move aside, ser.

172
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:51,992
(raspy breathing)

173
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,028
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

174
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,304
I choose violence.

175
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,707
(grunts)

176
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,245
(grunts)

177
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,753
(gasping)

178
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:25,926
(gasping)

179
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:49,049
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

180
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,022
(men shouting)

181
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:02,896
Looks like a siege, my lady.

182
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:06,366
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

183
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:18,211
My lady.
My lady.

184
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,917
Who goes there?!

185
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,252
State your business!

186
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,387
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

187
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:31,324
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

188
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:36,229
Tell him I have his sword.

189
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,632
<i>(men shouting)</i>

190
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:45,839
(grunting)

191
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,676
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

192
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:52,679
(coughing)

193
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:55,015
(laughs)

194
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,383
Podrick fucking Payne.

195
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:59,085
I thought you'd be dead by now.

196
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:00,587
Not yet.

197
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,188
(laughs)

198
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,357
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,330
You think they're fucking?

200
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:11,965
What?

201
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,667
No.

202
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,636
Why not?
I'd fuck her.

203
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:18,371
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

204
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:20,774
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

205
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:24,077
(chuckles) Well, he'd
fuck her, that's for sure.

206
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,146
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

207
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,081
The way she looks at him.

208
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,684
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

209
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:33,887
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

210
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:37,724
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

211
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:41,227
You must have shown it to her by now.

212
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,965
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

213
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:48,501
Oh. - An hour in the morning,
an hour at night.

214
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,403
Every day.

215
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:54,307
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

216
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,943
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

217
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,645
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

218
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:01,314
<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>

219
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,517
All right.

220
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:06,886
All right, let's start
with your footwork.

221
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:09,189
Show me your stance.

222
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,192
Now listen to me, Pod.

223
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,961
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

224
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:17,864
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

225
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:22,068
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.

226
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,771
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

227
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:26,473
Jaime: <i>I never thought
you'd find her.</i>

228
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,007
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

229
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,210
Why would you assume that?

230
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:34,247
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

231
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:36,983
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

232
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:40,019
Well, I'm proud of you.

233
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:42,722
<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

234
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:44,591
<i>against all odds.</i>

235
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:47,660
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

236
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:50,363
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

237
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:54,200
so there is that complication.

238
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,291
What the hell are you doing here?

239
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,072
I've come for the Blackfish.

240
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:00,974
You're welcome to have him.

241
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:04,844
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

242
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:08,114
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

243
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:11,284
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

244
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,752
The Tully army.

245
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:14,587
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

246
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,356
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

247
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,191
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

248
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:19,993
so you can see the conundrum.

249
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,195
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

250
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:24,731
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

251
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:28,334
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

252
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:29,836
Exactly.

253
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:35,475
We shouldn't argue about politics.

254
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:38,311
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

255
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,380
I know there is honor in you.

256
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:43,249
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

257
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,251
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

258
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:47,620
I do no such thing.

259
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:50,290
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

260
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:53,927
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

261
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,628
What do you propose?

262
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,399
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

263
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,835
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

264
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:03,937
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

265
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,640
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

266
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:12,512
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

267
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,417
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

268
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,586
All right.

269
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:22,088
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

270
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,491
He won't listen, but his men might.

271
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:27,060
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

272
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:29,195
I need your word.

273
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,432
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

274
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,968
you'll grant a safe passage north.

275
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,270
You have my word.

276
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:39,305
You have until nightfall.

277
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:56,122
(sighs)

278
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:58,892
You gave it to me for a purpose.

279
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:02,195
I've achieved that purpose.

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,666
It's yours.

281
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:10,403
It will always be yours.

282
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:21,714
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

283
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,950
Yes, Lady Brienne?

284
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:27,987
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

285
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,957
and if you attack the castle,

286
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,093
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

287
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:36,262
Of course it does.

288
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,864
To fight you.

289
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,537
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

290
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:56,816
Blackfish: <i>I've said no
three times already.</i>

291
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,152
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

292
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,054
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

293
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,323
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

294
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,893
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

295
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:10,530
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

296
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:12,565
I can feel it.

297
00:20:13,668 --> 00:20:15,234
As I have said,
my name is--

298
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:17,770
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

299
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,672
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

300
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,475
And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

301
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:25,011
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

302
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:27,413
on the Kingslayer's word of
honor, you're a bloody fool.

303
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:30,183
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

304
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:33,886
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

305
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,422
- He's not my friend.
- No?

306
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,160
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

307
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:44,030
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

308
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:47,934
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

309
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:51,270
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

310
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:53,473
He gave me this sword to protect her.

311
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:56,242
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

312
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,645
until the day I die.

313
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:11,691
(chuckles)

314
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:14,127
She's exactly like her mother.

315
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:23,469
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

316
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:25,638
You have more than she does.

317
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,274
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

318
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,243
But this is my home.

319
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:32,311
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

320
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:36,015
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

321
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:55,468
Find the maester.

322
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,271
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

323
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,774
What should I write?

324
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,446
Tell her I failed.

325
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,349
(chatter)

326
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:38,878
There's to be a royal announcement?

327
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,947
There is.

328
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,648
Why wasn't I informed?

329
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:47,720
There is to be a royal announcement

330
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:49,789
in the throne room

331
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:51,891
at this very moment.

332
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,929
Where are you going?

333
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,901
To stand by my son.

334
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:04,670
Your place is in the gallery

335
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:07,440
with the other ladies of the court.

336
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,783
Pycelle:
<i>Your Grace...</i>

337
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:37,136
Tommen:
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

338
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:39,872
the Faith and the Crown

339
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:43,209
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

340
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:46,946
One collapses, so does the other.

341
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:51,017
The Father judges us all.

342
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,552
If you break his laws...

343
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:57,690
<i>you will be punished.</i>

344
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,262
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

345
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:05,698
we have determined that Loras Tyrell

346
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,500
and Cersei Lannister's trial

347
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,669
<i>will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

348
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,271
<i>on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.</i>

349
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,141
(crowd murmuring)

350
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:21,647
Furthermore, after much prayer

351
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:23,816
<i>and reflection,</i>

352
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:27,019
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

353
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,088
trial by combat will be forbidden

354
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,224
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

355
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:32,959
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

356
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,261
Tommen: <i>The tradition
is a brutish one,</i>

357
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:37,330
<i>a scheme devised by corrupt rulers</i>

358
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:40,066
<i>in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.</i>

359
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:42,668
<i>Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell</i>

360
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,737
will stand trial before seven septons

361
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,640
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

362
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:49,876
<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

363
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,844
Crowd:
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

364
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:01,888
<i>(doors open)</i>

365
00:25:14,235 --> 00:25:16,702
Your Grace...

366
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:20,273
that old rumor you told me about.

367
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,277
My little birds investigated.

368
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:28,881
And?

369
00:25:28,983 --> 00:25:32,084
Was it just a rumor
or something more?

370
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:33,819
More.

371
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,657
Much more.

372
00:25:43,631 --> 00:25:45,831
Missandei:
<i>You seem happy.</i>

373
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,767
I am happy.

374
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:50,836
You should both be happy as well.

375
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:55,308
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

376
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,843
Now it's like a man reborn.

377
00:25:57,946 --> 00:26:00,046
I will be happy
when our queen returns.

378
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:03,816
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

379
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,251
Unsullied never drink.

380
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:06,619
- Why not?
- Rules.

381
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,021
And who made these rules?

382
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:11,023
Your former masters?

383
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:14,193
<i>Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.</i>

384
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:16,362
Have a drink with me.

385
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,601
And you?
What's your excuse?

386
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:25,137
I have tried wine before.

387
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,039
It made me feel funny.

388
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,108
That's how you know it's working.

389
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:34,080
Here's to our queen.

390
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:37,450
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

391
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:42,888
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

392
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:45,691
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

393
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:47,994
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

394
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:55,267
Tyrion:
<i>Do you like it?</i>

395
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,403
Tastes like it has turned.

396
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:00,740
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

397
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:08,914
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

398
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,885
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

399
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:16,822
Make my own wine.

400
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:19,425
The Imp's Delight.

401
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:21,994
Only my close friends could drink it.

402
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,167
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

403
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:30,836
I do not know any jokes.

404
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,071
Grey Worm?

405
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,375
Right.

406
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:41,247
Three lords
walk into a tavern--

407
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:43,849
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

408
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:45,451
<i>They order ale,</i>

409
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:48,054
but when the barkeep
brings them over,

410
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:50,656
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

411
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:55,094
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

412
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:59,365
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

413
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:04,103
The Stark reaches into his cup,

414
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:07,006
pulls out the fly and shouts,

415
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:09,675
"Spit it out, you wee shit.

416
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:11,110
Spit it out."

417
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:19,251
It's funnier in Westeros.

418
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:22,555
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

419
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:23,689
Yes.

420
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:27,426
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

421
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:29,662
Not a true story, necessarily.

422
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:32,765
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

423
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,667
<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

424
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:37,169
<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

425
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:38,704
I do.

426
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:40,139
Tell a joke.

427
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,014
Two translators
are on a sinking ship.

428
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:52,718
The first says,

429
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,187
"Do you know
how to swim?"

430
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:59,758
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

431
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:05,364
Ah!
(laughing)

432
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:10,936
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

433
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:12,705
You don't even know what a joke is.

434
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:15,708
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

435
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,177
You lied to us.

436
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:21,113
I make joke.

437
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,150
(laughing)

438
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,092
More jokes.

439
00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:35,561
I once walked into a brothel

440
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,296
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

441
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:40,065
- The madam says--
- <i>(bells ringing)</i>

442
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:44,003
(Grey Worm shouting in Valyrian)

443
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:48,474
<i>(bells continue ringing)</i>

444
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:54,980
The Masters have come
for their property.

445
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:07,026
(men shouting)

446
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:14,433
Lord Edmure.

447
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:18,837
<i>I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.</i>

448
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,207
A man of your birth deserves better.

449
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,277
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

450
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:29,248
I have your word?

451
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,350
(scoffs)

452
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,852
Oh, good.

453
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:35,988
Good, that's--

454
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,057
that's a fine thing.

455
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:42,795
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

456
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:44,863
Whatever game you're playing.

457
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,832
The Blackfish is an old man.

458
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:49,034
A good death is all he can hope for.

459
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:52,204
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

460
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:56,141
A son you sired
on your wedding night.

461
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:58,043
You're a potent man.

462
00:30:58,145 --> 00:31:00,479
A son I've never met

463
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:03,315
born of a wife that I haven't seen

464
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,750
since our first night together.

465
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:06,385
You should be with them both.

466
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:09,755
I can arrange that, you realize?

467
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:11,890
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

468
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:15,194
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

469
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:17,730
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

470
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:20,266
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

471
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,901
Is that it?

472
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:26,438
After you've massacred my family.

473
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,642
Kept me in a cell for years.

474
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:31,710
Stolen our lands.

475
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:34,380
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

476
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:36,615
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

477
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:39,218
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

478
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,560
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

479
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:44,423
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

480
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:45,758
It's not.

481
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:51,163
You understand. On some
level you understand

482
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:53,198
that you're an evil man.

483
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:54,933
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

484
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:57,336
Well, that is convenient for you.

485
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,243
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

486
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:06,745
<i>(chuckles)</i>

487
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:09,415
Your square jaw,

488
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:11,283
your golden armor.

489
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:16,055
Tell me, I want to know.

490
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:17,723
I truly do.

491
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,291
How do you live with yourself?

492
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,164
All of us have to believe

493
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:28,267
that we're decent, don't we?

494
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:31,537
You have to sleep at night.

495
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:34,073
How do you tell yourself

496
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:36,775
that you're decent

497
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:39,378
after everything that you've done?

498
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:47,553
I was your sister's prisoner once.

499
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:54,293
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

500
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:56,929
(laughs)

501
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:58,864
Yeah.

502
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:01,867
She should have killed you.

503
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:03,836
Perhaps, but she didn't.

504
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:08,974
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

505
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:11,343
<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

506
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:13,011
I admired her.

507
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:14,980
Far more than her husband or her son.

508
00:33:15,082 --> 00:33:17,349
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

509
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:20,091
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

510
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,354
You don't have a choice.

511
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,456
The love she had for her children,

512
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:26,525
I was a little awed by it.

513
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,994
Reminded me of my sister.

514
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:32,231
Oh.
Oh, I see.

515
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:35,868
You're a madman.

516
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,836
I'm not here to trade insults.

517
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,439
- Your sister was a strong--
- Don't talk about Cat!

518
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:44,443
- I'll talk about whomever I want.
- (grunts)

519
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,546
She loved her children.

520
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:50,215
I suppose all mothers do,

521
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:53,051
but Catelyn and Cersei,

522
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:55,220
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

523
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:58,123
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

524
00:33:58,225 --> 00:34:00,025
Start a war.

525
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:03,896
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

526
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,165
The things we do for love.

527
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:14,273
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

528
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,276
That's exactly why I came here.

529
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,046
I love Cersei.

530
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:23,182
You can laugh at that if you want.

531
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,350
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

532
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:27,319
She needs me.

533
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:31,256
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

534
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:37,830
I'll send for your baby boy.

535
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:41,200
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

536
00:34:41,302 --> 00:34:44,603
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

537
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:47,272
Your son doesn't matter to me.

538
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:51,043
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

539
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,279
Only Cersei.

540
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:58,417
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

541
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,587
who ever lived to get back to her,

542
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:04,189
that's what I'll do.

543
00:35:31,151 --> 00:35:33,719
Guard:
<i>Who goes there?</i>

544
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:35,554
Edmure Tully,

545
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:37,122
son of Hoster Tully

546
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:39,591
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

547
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:43,862
I demand entry.

548
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:46,765
Don't let him in.

549
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:49,234
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

550
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:50,569
I have to obey his commands.

551
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:52,271
He's been their captive

552
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:55,173
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

553
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:58,310
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

554
00:35:58,412 --> 00:36:01,680
would decide to let him come home?

555
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:04,950
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

556
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:06,351
Don't let him in.

557
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,153
He's my lord, my lord.

558
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:11,023
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

559
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,926
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

560
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:17,996
You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.

561
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:20,766
Edmure:
<i>I demand entry.</i>

562
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,234
My lord has given an order.

563
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,336
With a knife to his throat.

564
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,872
That is not a valid order.

565
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:33,712
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed--

566
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,081
Man:
Aye, ser.

567
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:39,718
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

568
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,488
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

569
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:58,070
- Lower the drawbridge.
- Man #2:<i> Aye, ser!</i>

570
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:44,182
Black Walder:
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

571
00:37:44,284 --> 00:37:47,953
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

572
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,728
Welcome home, my lord.

573
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,703
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

574
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,573
Open the gates.

575
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:44,509
- My lord--
- Your lord has given a command.

576
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,206
<i>(men shouting)</i>

577
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:21,546
Man:
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

578
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:37,462
Find the Blackfish.

579
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:40,799
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

580
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:46,471
Find him.

581
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,465
Go on.

582
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:14,800
Come with us.

583
00:40:14,902 --> 00:40:16,434
I've run before from the Red Wedding.

584
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:18,837
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

585
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:22,574
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

586
00:40:22,676 --> 00:40:25,710
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

587
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:30,982
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

588
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:37,656
Guard:
<i>All the way down!</i>

589
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:40,559
- <i>Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

590
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:43,662
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

591
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:46,498
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

592
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:54,005
<i>(men shouting)</i>

593
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:23,268
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

594
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,936
Good.

595
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:27,339
Bring him to me.

596
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,841
He died fighting, my lord.

597
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:34,851
(men shouting)

598
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,167
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

599
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:04,669
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

600
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:05,825
If the slavers' forces--

601
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,855
No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.

602
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:09,615
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying--

603
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:11,563
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

604
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:14,079
<i>You do not know
what the army should do.</i>

605
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:16,348
All right, what should the army do?

606
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,216
We'll not go to the beach.

607
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:20,618
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

608
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:23,154
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

609
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:24,689
- We stay here.
- And then?

610
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,591
We wait for them to come to us.

611
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:28,893
Then we fight them.

612
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:31,963
<i>(thudding, rattling)</i>

613
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,667
<i>(thumping)</i>

614
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,905
(dragon screeches)

615
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:19,277
<i>- (distant horse whinnies)
- (men shouting)</i>

616
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:40,765
Clegane.

617
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:42,967
What the fuck you doing here?

618
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,170
Chasing them.
You?

619
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:47,105
Hanging them.

620
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:48,907
Any particular reason?

621
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:51,376
They're our men.
Or they were.

622
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:54,045
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

623
00:44:54,147 --> 00:44:55,313
<i>Why do you want them?</i>

624
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:56,915
Same reason.

625
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:59,050
I was helping build it.

626
00:44:59,152 --> 00:45:01,386
<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

627
00:45:01,488 --> 00:45:02,754
You've got friends?

628
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:05,723
Not anymore.
They're mine.

629
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:08,426
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

630
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:10,161
Fuck your name.
They're mine.

631
00:45:10,263 --> 00:45:11,796
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

632
00:45:11,898 --> 00:45:13,865
Happy to do it again.

633
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:16,234
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

634
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:20,071
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

635
00:45:22,342 --> 00:45:23,641
You can have one of them.

636
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:29,848
Two.

637
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,595
No, no, no.

638
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:46,164
We're not butchers.
We hang them.

639
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:47,899
Hanging?

640
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,400
All over in an instant.

641
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:50,935
Where's the punishment in that?

642
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:53,638
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

643
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,207
Except this one here.

644
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,376
I'll only gut one of them.

645
00:45:58,478 --> 00:46:00,912
Beric:
<i>No.</i>

646
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:02,780
I'll chop off one hand.

647
00:46:02,883 --> 00:46:05,950
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

648
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:07,452
That's generous.

649
00:46:11,224 --> 00:46:14,292
Bunch of nancies.

650
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:16,895
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

651
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:18,163
just to gut these three.

652
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:19,564
You're getting old, Clegane.

653
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,132
He's not.

654
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:23,134
(gasping)

655
00:46:23,236 --> 00:46:25,770
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

656
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:28,673
(choking)

657
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,310
(choking)

658
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,517
(choking continues)

659
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,234
Got anything to eat?

660
00:46:56,336 --> 00:46:59,003
<i>(distant horse whinnying)</i>

661
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:10,682
Enjoying yourself?

662
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:12,850
I prefer chicken.

663
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:17,622
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

664
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:21,392
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

665
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:24,429
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

666
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:29,367
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

667
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:31,836
He gave a failed, drunk priest

668
00:47:31,938 --> 00:47:34,672
the power to bring him
back for a reason.

669
00:47:34,774 --> 00:47:37,108
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

670
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,378
Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done

671
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,547
for something larger than ourselves.

672
00:47:49,856 --> 00:47:52,857
Cold winds are rising in the North.

673
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:55,260
And you're going to go stop them?

674
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:57,929
We need good men to help us.

675
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,799
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

676
00:48:03,436 --> 00:48:05,036
Beric:
<i>True enough.</i>

677
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:08,206
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

678
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:10,808
- Why?
- (laughs)

679
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,811
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

680
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:18,149
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

681
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:21,219
and I'm better than you now.

682
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:23,121
Aye, you're probably right.

683
00:48:23,223 --> 00:48:26,057
You're a fighter.

684
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,393
You were born a fighter.

685
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:30,895
You walked away from the fight.

686
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:32,664
How did that go?

687
00:48:35,468 --> 00:48:38,736
Good and bad, young and old,

688
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:41,606
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

689
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:46,678
<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

690
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,680
It's not too late for you.

691
00:48:56,156 --> 00:48:58,156
<i>(footsteps approach)</i>

692
00:49:14,574 --> 00:49:16,641
(groans)

693
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:50,341
<i>- (thuds)
- (gasping)</i>

694
00:49:52,479 --> 00:49:54,278
Lady Crane?

695
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:58,116
(winces)

696
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,389
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

697
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:14,432
If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.

698
00:50:16,669 --> 00:50:18,770
Instead...

699
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,307
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

700
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:26,811
He must always receive what is his.

701
00:50:26,913 --> 00:50:29,614
You can't change that.

702
00:50:29,716 --> 00:50:32,150
I can't change that.

703
00:50:32,252 --> 00:50:34,285
No one can.

704
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:39,390
And now he's been
promised another name.

705
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:47,665
(grunts)

706
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:57,141
- Hey!
- Get out!

707
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,946
- Yah!
- (grunts)

708
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:47,358
- (man coughs)
- (gasps)

709
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:55,066
(chatter)

710
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:09,146
- (grunts)
- (woman screams)

711
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:23,194
Hey!

712
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:27,832
- Yah!
- (man shouts)

713
00:52:28,902 --> 00:52:30,434
Ah!

714
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:32,837
(crowd shouts)

715
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:37,275
(groans)

716
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,446
(crowd clamoring)

717
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,882
Woman:
My basket!

718
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:48,352
(panting)

719
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:54,025
(groaning)

720
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,794
(whimpering)

721
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,993
(panting)

722
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,478
It will all be over soon.

723
00:54:21,914 --> 00:54:24,715
On your knees or on your feet?

724
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:32,723
(groans)

725
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:37,695
Haven't we been through this already?

726
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:41,632
That won't help you.

727
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,372
You told her to kill me.

728
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:03,714
Yes.

729
00:56:03,816 --> 00:56:06,283
<i>But here you are.</i>

730
00:56:06,385 --> 00:56:09,086
And there she is.

731
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:22,166
Finally a girl is no one.

732
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:29,073
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

733
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:31,308
and I'm going home.
