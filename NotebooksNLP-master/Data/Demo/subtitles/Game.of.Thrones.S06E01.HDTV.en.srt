<i>We've committed treason, all of us.</i>

48
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,275
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

49
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:13,077
I had no love for him.

50
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,530
That was no secret.

51
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:19,867
But I never once disobeyed an order.

52
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:22,370
Loyalty is the foundation

53
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:24,505
on which the Night's Watch is built.

54
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,958
And the Watch means everything to me.

55
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:29,010
I have given my life,

56
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:33,214
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

57
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:40,104
Jon Snow was going to
destroy the Night's Watch.

58
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:42,807
<i>He let the wildlings
through our gates</i>

59
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,361
as no Lord Commander
has ever done before.

60
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:51,232
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

61
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:55,069
and raped and murdered.

62
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,407
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

63
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:02,410
I've no doubt about that.

64
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:06,714
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

65
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,001
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

66
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,254
And we made it.

67
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:19,093
(men murmuring)

68
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,932
(whimpering)

69
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,268
Davos: <i>He'll have
seen we didn't come.</i>

70
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,437
Thorne will have
made it official by now.

71
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,022
Castle Black is his.

72
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:34,275
I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

73
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,943
Jon was my friend.

74
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,247
And those fuckers butchered him.

75
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,783
Now we return the favor.

76
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,284
We don't have the numbers.

77
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,336
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

78
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,455
<i>I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long,</i>

79
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,758
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

80
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:55,346
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

81
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,632
We all die today.

82
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,435
I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.

83
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,938
We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

84
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,441
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

85
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:09,894
You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

Bolt the door.

87

Don't let anyone in.

88
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,991

The kennelmaster's daughter.

94

She smelled of dog.

95
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:53,354
I wasn't much older, but everybody
was already afraid of me.

96
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,024
You certainly were.

97
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,031
Myranda wasn't, though.

98
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:08,002
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

99
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,954
She was fearless.

100
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,707
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

101
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:22,216
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

102
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,889
I wish you could be here to watch.

103

Maester: <i>Shall I have a
grave dug for her, my lord?</i>

104
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,318
<i>Or would you rather
the men build a pyre?</i>

105
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,458
Buried, burned?

106
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:49,210
This is good meat.

107
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,745
Feed it to the hounds.

108
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,466
Roose: Your command of the
cavalry was impressive.

109
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:58,469
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

110
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:01,222
Do you know who struck
the killing blow?

111
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,307
- No.
- A shame.

112
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:05,309
I'd reward the man.

113
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,729
Still, a great victory.

114
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:10,848
Do you feel like a victor?

115
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,822
I rebelled against the crown

116
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,991
to arrange your marriage
to Sansa Stark.

117
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,610
Do you think that
burning wagons in the night

118
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,946
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

119
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:28,366
is the same as facing a prepared
and provisioned Lannister army?

120
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:32,870
No.

121
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:36,457
A reckoning will come.

122
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,175
We need the North to face it.

123
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,127
The entire North.

124
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:43,464
They won't back us
without Sansa Stark.

125
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:47,218
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

126
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,520
You played your games with her.

127
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,140
You played your games with the heir to the
Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

128
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:56,143
I have a team of men after them

I'm glad to hear it.

131
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:03,284
Without Sansa, you won't be
able to produce an heir.

132
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:06,454
And without an heir, well...

133
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,626

- Dead.
- Liar.

Lady Sansa, I offer

and give my life

I swear it by the old

And I vow...

203

A ship from Dorne

00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,358
Myrcella.

Do you remember the first

Mother.

220
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,358
All I could think about when she died

221
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,660
was what would happen to her now.

222
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:13,283
Every day, every night,

223
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,702
what does Mama look like now?

224
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,340
Has she started to bloat?

225
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:24,378
Has her skin turned black?

226
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:28,549
Have her lips peeled
back from her teeth?

227
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:36,390
I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.

228
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,777
I think about her beautiful
little face starting to collapse.

229
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:44,064
Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.

230
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,866
I have to.

231
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,037
I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

232
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:53,373
She's not suffering.
She's gone.

233
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:56,326
No one can hurt her anymore.

234
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,713
She was good.

235
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,001
From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

236
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:07,754
I don't know where she came from.

237
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:12,759
She was nothing like me.

238
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,312
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

239
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,097
I know.

240
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:21,435
<i>I thought if I could
make something so good,</i>

241
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,104
so pure...

242
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:29,443
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>

243
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,079
She was my daughter and I failed her.

244
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:34,665
No, I knew this would happen.

245
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,917
The witch told me years ago.

246
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:41,955
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

247
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,625
"And gold their shrouds."

248
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,293
Everything she said came true.

249
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,128
You couldn't have stopped it.

250
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,880
It's prophecy.
It's fate.

251
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:52,966
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

252
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,220
You told me yourself
when Father died.

253
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,188
You said we had to stay together.

254
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:01,525
You said people would try to
tear us apart, take what's ours.

255
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,143
That was a prophecy, too.

256
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,529
I didn't listen to you and
everything you said came true.

257
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:08,065
Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.

258
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,534
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

259
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,152
We're the only ones who matter,

260
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,371
the only ones in this world.

261
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,930
And everything they've taken from us,

262
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,075
we're going to take back and more.

263
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:23,330
We're going to take
everything there is.

264
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:34,308
"The Seven Hells brim
with the souls of saintly men.

265

They scream in agony

266
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,313
they do not feel the flames,

267
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:42,316
for now they see
if not for a single sin

268
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,152
they concealed,
they were saved."

269
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:47,154
I'd like to see my brother.

270
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,523
- Confess.
- Please.

271
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,608
How is he?
At least tell me that.

272
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,026
Confess.

273
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,199
I am the queen and I
demand to see my brother.

274

<i>Sinners don't make demands.</i>

275

281
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:30,897
Septa Unella can be
overzealous at times.

282
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,399
I'll speak with her.

283
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:37,204
My brother, can you
tell me how he is?

284
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:42,909
It isn't Ser Loras
that brings me here.

285
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:46,079
Your husband misses you dearly.

286
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:50,217
The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

287
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:53,470
It reflects the love
the gods have for all of us.

288
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,058
But sin leads us away
from the sacred.

289
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,977
And only confession can purge sin.

290
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,764
I have nothing to confess.

291
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,485
So you believe you are pure?

00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:10,437
Perfect?

Wholly without sin?

None of us are.

295
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:20,364
You have started down the path.

296
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,950

<i>(door opens, closes)</i>

298
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,550
I always envied Oberyn.

299
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:42,352
He lived.

300
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,054
He truly lived.

301
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,972
Sailed around the world.

302
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:47,974
Fought men from every country.

303
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,477
Lay with the most
beautiful women alive.

304
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:52,646
- And men.
- And men.

305
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:55,315
He experienced everything

306
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:58,318
while I sat here in Dorne

307
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:03,323
trying my best to keep my
people alive and well fed.

308
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,158
But that is life.

309
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,879
We each have our roles.

310
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:13,750
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

311
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:15,719
And I was born to rule.

312
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:17,587
The gods are not fools.

313
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:20,557
You would have been
a lousy adventurer.

314
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:23,143
And Oberyn, pfft,

315
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,928
he would have been a terrible ruler.

316
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:28,398
Your mother is a brilliant
woman, you know that?

Maester:
<i>Prince Doran.</i>

When was the last time
you left this palace?

321
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:08,221
You don't know your own people.

322

<i>- Their disgust for you.

Elia Martell raped and
murdered, and you did nothing.

324
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:20,233
Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

325
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,037
You're not a Dornishman.

326
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:27,374
You're not our prince.

327
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,745
My son Trystane...

328
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,413
(scoffs)

329
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,816
Your son is weak just like you.

330
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:40,987
And weak men will never
rule Dorne again.

331
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:06,263
I told you I'm not hungry.

332
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:08,515
We're not here to feed you.

333
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,719
We're here to kill you.

334
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:15,522
You want her to do it or me?

335
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:19,226
We are family.
I don't want to hurt you.

336
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:22,062
Her or me?

337
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:27,651
You.

338
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:29,619
Good.

339
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,072
Smart boy.

340
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,258
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

341
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:58,598
<i>(door opens, door closes)</i>

342
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,735
Tyrion: We're never going to fix
what's wrong with this city

343
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,354
from the top
of an 800-foot pyramid.

344
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,856
We'll be fine.

345
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:09,442
We're dressed like common merchants.

346
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,363
You walk like a rich person.

347
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:16,416
You've spent a lot of time
studying the way rich people walk?

348
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:20,503
You walk as though the paving
stones were your personal property.

349
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:23,790
I used to steal from people
like you when I was a boy.

350
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,925
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

351
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:29,629
Because you have no cock.

352
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,102
(baby fussing)

353
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,172
_

354
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:46,157
_

355
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,483
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

356
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:53,320
_

357
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,298
_

358
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,267
_

359
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:08,501
(speaks Valyrian)

360
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:16,843
- Varys: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
- <i>I know what mhysa means.</i>

361
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,812
- Varys: Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

362
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,432
Our queen is not as popular
in Meereen as she used to be.

363
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,267
The Sons of the Harpy?

364
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:25,935
Very possibly.

365
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:30,740
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

366
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:34,778
told them human beings weren't
even property to begin with.

367
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:37,030
You can see why they're unhappy.

368
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:39,416
Of course,

369
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:42,202
it could also be the freed men.

370
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:45,705
_

371
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:50,043
_

372
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,247
_

373
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:57,100
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

374
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:00,553
She did fly away on a
dragon and not come back.

375
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,240
_

376
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:09,139
_

377
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:13,007
_

378
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:17,869
_

379
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:20,407
It's a problem.

380
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:25,078
Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

381
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,299
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

382
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:32,585
someone in this city
wants to murder you.

383
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:35,672
We can't fight
an enemy we don't know.

384
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:39,189
The Sons of the Harpy
planned their attack

385
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:41,141
in the fighting pits very carefully,

386
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:43,894
which means they take
orders from someone.

387
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,113
And have you started
looking for that someone?

388
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:48,983
My little birds
have already taken wing.

389
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:53,570
Soon they'll return, singing
songs of men in gold masks.

390
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:57,458
<i>(men shouting in Valyrian)</i>

391
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,994

392
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,428
- (shouting continues)
- <i>(bell continues tolling)</i>

393
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:32,443
Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

394
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:56,266
Goat?

395
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,968
Ram.

396
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:59,720
You think our friend got him?

397
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:04,141
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

398
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,395
We're on the right path, then.

399
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:11,615
Daario: Perhaps she's
tired of being queen.

400
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,784
I don't think she likes it very much.

401
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:16,070
She's too smart to like it.

402
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,988
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

403
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:20,074
somewhere far away from men like us.

404
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,993
I've been all over the world.

405
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,995
There's no escaping men like us.

406
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:27,798
There's no escaping her, eh?

407
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:31,085
You keep coming back.
Why?

408
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,669
You know why.

409
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,757
Isn't it frustrating

410
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:40,260
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

411
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:41,812
Of course it is.

412
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:44,481
You're a romantic.
I admire that.

413
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,567
Sometimes I look at you and I think,

414
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,986
"So that's what I'll be like
when I grow old."

415
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:50,771
If you grow old.

416
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:52,106
If I grow old.

417
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,408
I hope I do.

418
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,243
I want to see what
the world looks like

419
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:57,945
when she's done conquering it.

420
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
So do I.

421
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:22,553
Daario:
Huh, an army?

422
00:34:22,638 --> 00:34:24,054
Not an army.

423
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,889
A horde.

424
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,749
Dothraki?

425
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:17,858
They have her.

426
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,376

427
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,150

498
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:55,622
Man: <i>I know, but have you
tried telling him that?</i>

499
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:59,759
(chatter continues)

500
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,515
Thank you.

501
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:08,151
Man: Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

502
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,936
- Man #2: <i>Probably had it coming.</i>
- Man:<i> Maybe so,</i>

503
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:11,655
<i>but I'm not risking it.</i>

504
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:13,356
- Man #2: <i>Just can't do it.</i>
- Man:<i> All right.</i>

505
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,859
Woman: <i>Honesty as well. He gets it.</i>

506
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:18,612
(chatter continues)

507
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:22,449
Waif: <i>Are you listening, blind girl?</i>

508
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,786
Do you hear them talking?

509
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:29,589
<i>Do any of them talk to you?</i>

510
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,091
<i>No.</i>

511
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,044
So sad.

512
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:38,264
(coins jingle)

513
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:43,219
- (groans)
- Stand and fight, blind girl.

514
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:46,439
I can't see.

515
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,642
That's your problem, not mine.

516
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:50,477
(groans)

517
00:42:53,482 --> 00:42:55,398
(grunts)

518
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:02,822
(panting)

519
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,830
(grunts)

520
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:18,338
See you tomorrow.

521
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:30,266
(panting)

522
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:02,882
(growling)

523
00:44:08,557 --> 00:44:10,273
<i>(pounding)</i>

524
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:14,277
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

525
00:44:14,396 --> 00:44:16,529
We are both anointed knights.

526
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:20,200
Hear that, lads?
Nothing to fear.

527
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,452
Alliser: <i>I will grant
amnesty to all brothers</i>

528
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:24,904
<i>who throw down their arms
before nightfall.</i>

529
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,625
<i>And you, Ser Davos, I will
allow you to travel south</i>

530
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:31,578
a free man with a fresh horse.

531
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:35,298
Davos:
<i>And some mutton.</i>

532
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:36,966
<i>I'd like some mutton.</i>

533
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:40,887
- What?
- I'm not much of a hunter.

534
00:44:40,972 --> 00:44:44,591
I'll need some food if I'm gonna
make it south without starving.

535
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,597
We'll give you food.

536
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:53,900
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

537
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:57,437
<i>Or you can leave her here with
us, whichever you choose.</i>

538
00:44:57,522 --> 00:45:02,358
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

539
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,829
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

540
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:10,083
We'll discuss amongst ourselves and
come back to you with an answer.

541
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,128
<i>(footsteps departing)</i>

542
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:29,385
Boys, I've been running
from men like that all my life.

543
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,639
In my learned opinion,
we open that door--

544
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:34,190
And they'll slaughter us all.

545
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:36,609
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

546
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:40,196
- Aye, but we don't need to make it
easy for them. - <i>Edd is our only chance.</i>

547
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:43,650
It's a sad fucking statement if
Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

548
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,153
There's always the Red Woman.

549
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,956
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

550
00:45:51,576 --> 00:45:53,793
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.

551
00:48:40,095 --> 00:48:48,095
