For you, my lady.

6
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:24,050

Lady Brienne.

10
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,071
When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

11
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,308
You have no idea how happy I am

12
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,077
to see you unharmed.

13
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,447
Unharmed?

14
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,249
What are you doing here?

15
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,218
I rode north with the Knights of
the Vale to come to your aid.

16
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,155
<i>They're encamped
at Moat Cailin as we speak.</i>

17
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:04,057
To come to my aid?

18
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:08,394
Did you know about Ramsay?

19
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,730
If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

20
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,598
If you did know, you're my enemy.

21
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,703
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

22
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,107
He never hurt my face.

23
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,744
He needed my face, the face
of Ned Stark's daughter.

24
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,818
But the rest of me,

25
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,020
he did what he liked
with the rest of me

26
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:37,423
<i>as long as I could
still give him an heir.</i>

27
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,061
What do you think he did?

28
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:48,101
I can't begin
to contemplate--

29
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:50,203
What do you think he did to me?

30
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,647
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

31
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,216
He beat you.

32
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:04,584
Yes, he enjoyed that.

33
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,185
What else do you think he did?

34
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,454
- Sansa, I--
- What else?

35
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,625
Did he cut you?

36
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,430
- Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
- I didn't know.

37
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,432
I thought you knew
everyone's secrets.

38
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:22,869
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

39
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,570
I underestimated a stranger.

40
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,640
The other things he did,

41
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,542
ladies aren't supposed
to talk about those things,

42
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,478
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

43
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,283
I can still feel it.

44
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:40,520
I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

45
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:44,490
I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

46
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,029
I'm so sorry.

47
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,031
You said you would protect me.

48
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,668
And I will. You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

49
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,238
I don't believe you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

50
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,140
You can't protect me.

51
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,109
You won't even be able
to protect yourself

52
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,478
if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

53
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:09,448
And why shouldn't I?

54
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,620
Do you want me to beg for my life?

55
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:17,056
If that's what you want, I will.

56
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:21,561
Whatever you ask that is in my power,

57
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:22,862
I will do.

58
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:26,799
What if I want you
to die here and now?

59
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,536
Then I will die.

60
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,875
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

61
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:40,012
and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

62
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,749
<i>Go back to Moat Cailin.</i>

63
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:46,252
My brother and I will take
back the North on our own.

64
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:47,887
I never want to see you again.

65
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:51,224
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

66
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:55,895
I know that I can't.

67
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:00,666
Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

68
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,839
<i>Your great-uncle
Brynden the Blackfish</i>

69

Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

70
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,845
You might consider seeking him out.

71
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:16,249
The time may come when you
need an army loyal to you.

72
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,351
I have an army.

73
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,418
Your brother's army.

74
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:28,961
Half-brother.

She has a point.

84
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,484
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

85
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,553
They began as slaves
in the mines of Valyria.

86
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:36,188
Who was the first?

87
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,690
He was no one.

88
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:42,028
The Many-Faced God taught
him how to shed his face

89
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,763
and how to give the gift.

90
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,299
The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

91
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,836
Many served, many more
gifts were given.

92
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:53,806
Soon all the masters
and overseers were gone

93
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,108
and the Faceless Men fled.

94
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,010
Where did they go?

95
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,712
Here.

96
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:03,115
They founded the Free City of
Braavos and built this house.

97
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,453
These were the faces
they wore in life

98
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,089
when they were not wearing others.

99
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,958
The first Faceless Men.

100
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,295
And now a girl is one of them,

101
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,597
if a girl desires.

102
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,268
A girl has no desires.

103
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,077
Who?

104
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:41,287
<i>An actress who calls
herself Lady Crane.</i>

105

She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

<i>A girl has been given
a second chance.</i>

107

There will not be a third.

108
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,499
One way or another,

109
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,602
a face will be added to the hall.

The great big hairy whore.

He dug in his tusks
and dug out my guts

117
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,005
and soon I am no more.

118
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:36,008
Oh, come, Father,
in bed you must lie.

- (laughs)

121
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:46,619
I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:50,122
And our son alone

without a guiding hand.

Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

125

To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

126

Truly you should. Killing the
man will do you no good.

- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

<i>Show the people what
a good king should be.</i>

<i>All is well.</i>

173
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,502
I have here a decree

00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,371
from my father Tywin Lannister,

175
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,573
the richest man you'll see.

176
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,209
He proclaims me Hand of the King.

177
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,111
The position's mine for life.

178
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,580
And he's given me permission to take

179
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,816
Sansa as my wife.

It's a wart.
Two warts.

187
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,809
I've got two fucking
warts on my cock.

188
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:00,746
Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.

189
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:04,116
Oh, wash this, darling.
It stinks of me.

190
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,453
You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

191
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,221
I had two lines.

192
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:11,523
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

193
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,192
I rang very false?

194
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:16,195
What you need, love, is for
someone to ring you true.

195
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:17,996
(laughs)

196
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,666
Bianca: You weren't complaining
about me last night.

197
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,728
Tyrion actor: <i>May I get you
some wine, Lady Crane?</i>

198
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,870
Lady Crane:
<i>I'm a rum girl, Bobono.</i>

199
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:27,206
You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.

200
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:28,874
Of course we're going to be intimate.

201
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:31,543
It's only a matter of time.

202
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,146
<i>(rum pouring)</i>

203
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,248
To our children.

204
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,350
May they have your talent.

205
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,352
And your filthy mind.

206
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,087
(chuckles)

207
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:49,461
A girl will poison the rum.

208
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,797
Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.

209
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,904
If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

210
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,140
A girl is not ready.

211
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,111
She's a good actress.

212
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,547
So a man has heard.

213
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,483
Seems like a decent woman.

214
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,923
Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

215
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,560
No.

216
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,865
Who wants her dead?

217
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,768
That does not matter.
The price was paid.

218
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,540
The younger actress.

219
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,976
She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.

220
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,580
A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

221
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:44,750
A girl has decided.

222
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:48,487
A servant does not ask questions.

It was you.

235

You made the white walkers.

236
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,855
We were at war.

<i>Our sacred trees cut down.</i>

00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:37,696
We needed to defend ourselves.

240
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,298
From whom?

241
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,934
From you.

242
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:44,236
From men.

243
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,582
Aeron: We speak in the
presence of the Drowned God.

244

In his name we gather today

to choose a new king as our leader.

Who makes a claim?

247
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,597
I am Yara Greyjoy,

248
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:14,099
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

249
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,435
King of the Iron Islands.

250
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:19,705
I claim the Salt Throne.

251
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,374
We've never had a queen.
Not once.

252
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,910
There are many things
we've never done.

253
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,746
We've never made our mark
upon the world.

254
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:31,283
The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

255
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:34,419
until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

256
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,154
<i>long enough to become a nuisance.</i>

257
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,523
Then they swat us down.

258
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:42,127
They conquer us, humiliate us,

259
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,663
<i>and go right back
to forgetting we exist.</i>

- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that--

264

- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

265
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,177
Yes, you are!
A woman will not lead us.

266
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,614
Not when Balon's
own male heir has returned.

267
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,677
I am Theon Greyjoy...

00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:36,048
last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

269
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,692
And she is your rightful ruler.

Men:
Aye!

271
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:49,728
Those of you that have
sailed under her,

272
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,730
and there are many of you here,

273
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:54,433
- <i>you know what she is.</i>
- Aye!

274
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,834
- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

275
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,170
- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

276
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:00,038
She is ironborn!

277
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,740
Aye!

278
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:04,409
We will find no better leader.

279
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:09,281
This is our queen.

Nephew.

Little Theon.

288

<i>Captured a castle you couldn't keep.</i>

00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:53,825
Got yourself taken prisoner.

292
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,128
Even heard you have no cock.

294
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,400
Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

295
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,269
When did you return, Uncle?

296
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:06,571
A few days ago.

297
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:09,040
I had some things to take care of.

298
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,909
Long overdue.

299
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:13,779
I'm glad you're here.

300
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,518
Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

301
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,454
To execute the man
who killed my father.

302
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:25,157
(men murmuring)

303
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,362
I did.

304
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,597
I killed him.

305
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,668
Threw him right over a rope bridge

306
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,938
and watched him fall.

307
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,706
<i>He was leading us nowhere</i>

308
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,442
and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

309
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:47,612
<i>No one loved him.
No one wanted to follow him.</i>

310
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:50,448
He led us into two wars
we couldn't win.

311
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:54,519
I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

312
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,822
That would have been hard to do.

313
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,890
You weren't here.

314
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:02,561
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

315
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,129
Gallivanting?

316
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:05,931
That the sort of thing
you start to say

317
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,466

<i>Getting ready to bring us
back to glory.</i>

323
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,548
Euron:
<i>And how will she do that?</i>

324
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,019
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

325
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:34,426
Right idea, except I'm the one who's
going to build the Iron Fleet

326
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:36,828
<i>because I'm the one
who knows how to use it.</i>

327
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,396
<i>I've been all over the world.</i>

328
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:41,833
I've seen more of it
than all of you combined.

329
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:44,870
And across the sea there is a person

330
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:48,807
who hates the great lords of
Westeros just as much as we do.

331
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,509
Someone with a large army,

332
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:55,380
three large dragons, and no husband.

333
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,716
<i>I'm going to build that fleet</i>

334
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,018
and I'm going to gallivant right over

335
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,254
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen

336
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:04,756
- along with my big cock.
- (men laugh)

337
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,858
You're going to seduce
the Dragon Queen?

338
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,195
I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

339
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:13,098
And together we're going
to take the Seven Kingdoms.

340
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,568
I wasn't born to be king.

341
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,170
I paid the iron price

342
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,739
and here I stand.

343
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:22,474
(cheering)

344
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:26,278
(men chanting)
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

345
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,315
Euron! Euron!
Euron! Euron!

346
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,584
Euron! Euron!

347
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:46,498
May Euron, your servant,
be born again

348
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,134
from the sea as you were.

349
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:52,304
<i>Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.</i>

350
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:54,306
<i>Bless him with steel.</i>

351
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:57,042
<i>Listen to the waves.
Listen to the god.</i>

352
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,278
<i>He is speaking to us and he says</i>

353
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,417
<i>we shall have no king
but Euron Greyjoy.</i>

354
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,720
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

355
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,089
<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

356
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:13,992
<i>Let his lungs fill with seawater.</i>

357
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,968
<i>Let the fish eat
the scales off his eyes.</i>

358
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,637
<i>What is dead may never die,</i>

359
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:29,374
but rises again harder and stronger.

360
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,452
(gagging, coughing)

361
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,888
<i>(gasping)</i>

362
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,710
What is dead may never die.

363
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:42,047
All: What is dead may never die.

364
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:45,016
(cheers)

365
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:58,430
Where are my niece and nephew?

366
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:05,537
Let's go murder them.

367
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,792
Aeron:
<i>They stole our best ships.</i>

368
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,096
Won't be enough to save them.

369
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,033
Go back to your homes.

370
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,502
Chop down every tree you can find.

371
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:40,171
Quarter-saw the timber
and start building.

372
00:26:40,273 --> 00:26:42,340
I want every man bending planks.

373
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:45,944
I want every woman
spinning flax for sails.

374
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:48,346
Build me a thousand ships

375
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,915
and I will give you this world.

376
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,837
I banished you twice.

377
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:17,108
You came back twice.

378
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:22,347
And you saved my life.

379
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,987
So I can't take you back

380
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,189
and I can't send you away.

381
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,660
You must send me away.

382
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,441
Is there a cure?

383
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,844
I don't know.

384
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,813
How long does it take?

385
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:58,416
I don't know that either.

386
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,919
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

387
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:04,055
I'll end things before that.

388
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:09,727
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:11,996
I'm so sorry.

390
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:14,299
Don't be.

391
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,868
All I've ever wanted
was to serve you.

392
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,607
Tyrion Lannister was right.

393
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:27,845
I love you.

394
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,452
I'll always love you.

395
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,059
Good-bye, khaleesi.

396
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,733
Do not walk away from your queen,

397
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:50,902
Jorah the Andal.

398
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,306
You have not been dismissed.

399
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:59,043
You pledged yourself to me.

400
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:02,447
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

401
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:08,086
<i>Well, I command you to find the cure</i>

402
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:10,722
<i>wherever it is in this world.</i>

403
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,793
I command you to heal yourself

404
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:18,763
<i>and then return to me.</i>

405
00:29:21,868 --> 00:29:24,602
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

406
00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:27,171
I need you by my side.

407
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:09,547
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

408
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:12,950
how many killings have been carried
out by the Sons of the Harpy?

409
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,619
None.

410
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:17,655
And how many Masters have been
butchered by the free men?

411
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:20,325
Two, but that was
the day of the pact.

412
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:22,160
<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

413
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:25,263
So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

414
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,731
For now.

415
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,733
For now is the best we
get in our profession.

416
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,335
It's not enough.

417
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,236
Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

418
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,838
I'd say it's a good start.

419
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,507
It's not enough
for Meereen to have peace.

420
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:39,077
They need to know Daenerys
is responsible for it.

421
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,946
The Sons of the Harpy
have a good story.

422
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,215
Resist the foreign invaders.

423
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,417
Our queen has an even better story.

424
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,189
Mother of Dragons, Breaker
of Chains and all that.

425
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,658
The people know
who brought them freedom.

426
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,227
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

427
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,363
Who brought about
an end to the violence?

428
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:01,065
We need someone the people trust,

429
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,569
someone they know cannot
be bought or influenced.

430
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:07,805
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

431
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,174
Who said anything about "him"?

432
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:14,612
_

433
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,993
_

434
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:20,078
_

435
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:21,542
_

436
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:25,237
_

437
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:36,085
_

438
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:39,871
That's about the extent
of my Valyrian.

439
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,446
Thank you for travelling
all this way.

440
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:52,383
I know from personal experience how
uncomfortable the journey can be.

441
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,124
The truth is we need your help.

442
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:03,327
We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to--

443
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,663
You don't need to persuade me.

444
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:07,565
I came to help.

445
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,835
Daenerys Stormborn is the
one who was promised.

446
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:14,806
From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

447
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,908
Yes.

448
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,876
She has freed the slaves
from their chains

449
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,513
and crucified the Masters
for their sins.

450
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:24,382
She did indeed.

451
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,351
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

452
00:32:27,454 --> 00:32:29,287
a gift from the Lord of Light.

453
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:32,290
But you heard all of this
before, haven't you?

454
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:34,759
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

455
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,431
<i>The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,</i>

456
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,900
burning their sins and flesh away.

457
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,705
Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

458
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:50,808
The Mother of Dragons has followers
of many different faiths.

459
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,078
You want your queen to be
worshipped and obeyed.

460
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,981
And while she's gone,
you want her advisors

461
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,749
to be worshipped and obeyed.

462
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:02,086
I'd settle for obeyed.

463
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,189
<i>I will summon
my most eloquent priests.</i>

464
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,892
They will spread the word.

465
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:11,596
Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

466
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,800
in this war and in the
great war still to come.

467
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:17,368
That sounds most excellent.

468
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,438
A man named Stannis
Baratheon was anointed

469
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,307
as the chosen one
by one of your priestesses.

470
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,244
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

471
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:29,514
He attacked King's Landing
and was soundly defeated

472
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,716
by the man standing beside me.

473
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,285
Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

474
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,556
this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

475
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:41,759
We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

476
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:44,962
I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

477
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,599
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

478
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,868
You're always right.

479
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,571
Everything is the Lord's will.

480
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:57,341
Everything is the Lord's will.

481
00:33:57,443 --> 00:34:00,211
But men and women make mistakes.

482
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:02,246
Even honest servants of the Lord.

483
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:06,284
And you, an honest
servant of the Lord,

484
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:08,886
why should I trust you
to know any more

485
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:10,855
than the priestess
who counseled Stannis?

486
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:13,925
My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

487
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:16,761
but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

488
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,868
Everyone is what they are

489
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,672
and where they are for a reason.

490
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,942
Terrible things happen for a reason.

491
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:34,712
Take what happened to you, Lord
Varys, when you were a child.

492
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,149
<i>If not for your mutilation</i>

493
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:40,151
<i>at the hand of
a second-rate sorcerer,</i>

494
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:43,487
<i>you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen</i>

495
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,691
<i>bring his light into the world.</i>

496
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,027
Knowledge has made you powerful.

497
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,230
But there's still
so much you don't know.

498
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:58,336
<i>Do you remember
what you heard that night</i>

499
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:01,973
<i>when the sorcerer tossed
your parts in the fire?</i>

500
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:07,678
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

501
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:13,985
Should I tell you
what the voice said?

502
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:17,655
Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?

503
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,467
We serve the same queen.

504
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,602
If you are her true friend,

505
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:34,338
you have nothing to fear from me.

506
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,323
(raven caws)

507
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,684
(wind howling)

508
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,816
What?

509
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:48,899
(gasps)

510
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,749
(gasps)

511
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:09,486
(screams)

512
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:11,589
He saw me, the Night King!

513
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:13,858
- <i>He saw me!</i>
- He touched you.

514
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,528
I don't know.
He was close, but--

515
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,630
He touched you.

516
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:23,968
He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

517
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,469
But he can't get in.

518
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,106
He can now.
His mark is on you.

519
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,175
You must leave, all of you.

520
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:37,147
Meera: <i>Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.</i>

521
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,049
Hodor.

522
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,118
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

523
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,121
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

524
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:47,258
For you to become me.

525
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,462
But am I ready?

526
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:53,464
No.

527
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,135
We can't defend the north
from the walkers

528
00:39:58,237 --> 00:39:59,970
and the south from the Boltons.

529
00:40:00,072 --> 00:40:02,006
If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell

530
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,909
and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

531
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,781
Davos: <i>Aside from the
Starks and the Boltons,</i>

532
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:13,584
the most powerful houses in the North

533
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:15,719
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

534
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,454
and the Manderlys.

535
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:20,257
The Umbers and the Karstarks

536
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:22,293
have already declared
for the Boltons,

537
00:40:22,395 --> 00:40:24,028
so we're not doing so well there.

538
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,764
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

539
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:29,099
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay

540
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,702
without knowing
they had another choice.

541
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,138
I beg your pardon, my lady,

542
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,374
but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.

543
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,510
I don't think we can
count on them either.

544
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,881
How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

545
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,349
Precious little, my lady.

546
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,584
<i>My father always said
Northerners are different.</i>

547
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:51,388
More loyal, more
suspicious of outsiders.

548
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,057
They may well be loyal,

549
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,125
but how many rose up
against the Boltons

550
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:56,994
when they betrayed your family?

551
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,932
I may not know the North,
but I know men.

552
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:04,535
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

553
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:07,538
and even the bravest of
them don't want to see

554
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,941
their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

555
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:14,378
If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

556
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,447
they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

557
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:19,116
There are more than three
other houses in the North--

558
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:21,852
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

559
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:23,554
<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>

560
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:27,257
Two dozen more. Together
they equal all the others.

561
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,326
We can start small and build.

562
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:31,862
Sansa:
<i>The North remembers.</i>

563
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:33,430
<i>They remember the Stark name.</i>

564
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,432
People will still risk
everything for it,

565
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,735
from White Harbor
to Ramsay's own door.

566
00:41:37,837 --> 00:41:40,037
I don't doubt it.

567
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,239
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

568
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:44,408
No, but I do.

569
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,947
Jon is every bit
as much Ned Stark's son

570
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,849
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

571
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,991
<i>And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,</i>

572
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:57,054
<i>but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.</i>

573
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:58,689
I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.

574
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,724
My uncle the Blackfish
has reformed it

575
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:02,059
and retaken Riverrun.

576
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:04,228
How do you know that?

577
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:08,599
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

578
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:12,369
That's good.

579
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:14,471
The Blackfish is a legend.

580
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,974
His support would mean a great deal.

581
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,077
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

582
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:22,413
almost starts to look
like a winning side.

583
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:26,884
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

584
00:42:26,986 --> 00:42:28,752
You heard them.
We need more men

585
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,654
and my uncle has an army.

586
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,289
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

587
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,425
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.

588
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,193
It has to be you.

589
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:38,562
Ride for Riverrun.
My uncle will talk to you

590
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:40,464
and you'll know how to talk to him.

591
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:44,234
What is it?

592
00:42:46,038 --> 00:42:48,072
I don't like leaving you here alone.

593
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:49,473
With Jon?

594
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:52,342
Not him.
He seems trustworthy.

595
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,445
A bit brooding, perhaps.

596
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:56,613
I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

597
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,217
The others, though.

598
00:43:02,388 --> 00:43:06,023
Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother

599
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,724
with bloodmagic.

600
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,427
<i>And when Stannis paid for
his crime, where were they?</i>

601
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:14,731
Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

602
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,267
And that wildling fellow
with the beard--

603
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:20,604
Jon isn't Tormund. Jon
isn't Davos, the Red Woman

604
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:23,707
or Stannis for that matter.
Jon is Jon.

605
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,277
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.

606
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:33,684
Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?

607
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:44,561
New dress?

608
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,397
I made it myself.
Do you like it?

609
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,502
Yeah, it's--
I like the wolf bit.

610
00:43:51,604 --> 00:43:55,706
Good, because I made this for you.

611
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,711
<i>I made it like the one
Father used to wear.</i>

612
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:03,714
As near as I can remember.

613
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:07,184
Thank you, Sansa.

614
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:08,952
You're welcome.

615
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:31,608
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

616
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,644
I'll do my best.

617
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,185
Good luck.

618
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,851
Should we close the gate,
Lord Commander?

619
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:17,054
I'm not
the Lord Comman--

620
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:25,762
yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.

621
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,305
<i>(raven caws)</i>

622
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,509
Meera:
<i>We can go home now, Hodor.</i>

623
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,179
Well, maybe not home home,

624
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,481
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

625
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:45,983
(chuckles)
Hodor.

626
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:48,118
Eat something that isn't moss.

627
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,656
I want an egg.
How do you like 'em?

628
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:55,692
Boiled? Fried up
with some butter?

629
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,394
(laughs)
Hodor.

630
00:45:57,496 --> 00:46:01,064
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

631
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,466
Hodor.

632
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:04,628
Get Bran and run!

633
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,702
(white walkers snarling)

634
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:18,875
Bran.
Bran, wake up.

635
00:47:18,977 --> 00:47:22,012
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

636
00:47:22,114 --> 00:47:23,647
Bran, wake up.

637
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,293
- Man: <i>Gods keep you on the kingsroad.</i>
- Woman:<i> Take it easy.</i>

638
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,527
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

639
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:41,965
Hodor.

640
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,034
Hodor. Hodor.

641
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:46,603
Help me!

642
