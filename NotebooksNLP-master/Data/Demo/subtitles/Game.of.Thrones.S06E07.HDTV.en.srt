1
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:09,209
That's it. Get it right to the top.

2
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,112
Steady. Steady.

3
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,081
Up she goes.

4
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:50,817
Hey, come on. Put your
back into it, huh?

5
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:53,887
Here you are, son.

6
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:59,760
- Oh, gentlemen, please.
- To my right.

7
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:01,895
And you lot, come on.
Come on, get it moving.

8
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:04,397
Come on, come on.

9
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:51,808
In all my days I've never seen
a man swing an ax like that.

10
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,412
How many men did it
take to cut you down?

11
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:57,547
Just one.

12
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:01,485
He must have been some kind of monster.

13
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,821
He was a woman.

14
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:49,266
I think some of the men
are a bit afraid of you.

15
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,368
I'm used to it.

16
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:55,572
When I found you, I thought
you'd been dead for days.

17
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,708
The way you were stinking already

18
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,510
and you had bugs all over you

19
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:03,280
and bone was coming through right there.

20
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:09,186
I was gonna give you a proper
burial and then you coughed.

21
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:11,588
Oh, nearly shit myself.

22
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,390
I reckoned you were gonna die

23
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,892
by the time I loaded you on
the wagon, but you didn't.

24
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:19,062
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen
more times over the next few days,

25
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:21,565
but you didn't. What kept you going?

26
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:26,703
Hate.

27
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:30,873
No, there's a reason you're still here.

28
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,843
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big
fucker and I'm tough to kill.

29
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:36,413
No, a reason.

30
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,648
Gods aren't done with you yet.

31
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,785
I've heard that before.

32
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,088
Man was talking about a
different god, though.

33
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,324
Well, maybe he was right.

34
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,025
I don't know much about the gods.

35
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,428
You're in the wrong line of work.

36
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,430
Oh, there's plenty of
pious sons of bitches

37
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:56,032
who think they know the
word of god or gods.

38
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,602
I don't. I don't even
know their real names.

39
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:03,106
Maybe it is the Seven. Or
maybe it's the old gods.

40
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,108
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

41
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,944
Or maybe they're all the
same fucking thing.

42
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,646
I don't know.

43
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,748
What matters, I believe,

44
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,851
is that there's something
greater than us.

45
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:19,789
And whatever it is, it's got
plans for Sandor Clegane.

46
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:25,795
You didn't know me back in my time.

47
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,866
You don't know the things I've done.

48
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:33,603
I've heard stories.

49
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,674
If the gods are real...

50
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,011
why haven't they punished me?

51
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,049
They have.

52
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,965
Your Grace.

53
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,134
What are we reading today?

54
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,804
The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.

55
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,906
Chapter three, verse 12.

56
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,143
Ah, "As water rounds the
stones, smoothing..."

57
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:17,847
"Smoothing what was jagged,
so does a woman's love

58
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,982
calm a man's brute nature.

59
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,952
A wife salves her husband's wounds,

60
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:25,522
a mother sings her son to sleep."

61
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,658
You learn quickly.

62
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,696
There are some who know every
verse of the sacred text,

63
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:35,798
but don't have a drop of the
Mother's mercy in their blood

64
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,336
and savages who can't read at all

65
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:42,171
who understand the Father's wisdom.

66
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:47,210
For years I pretended

67
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:49,446
to love the poor, the afflicted.

68
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:53,950
I had pity for them, but
I never loved them.

69
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:56,819
They disgusted me.

70
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:59,155
They are hard to love.

71
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:02,392
The poor disgust us because they are us,

72
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,827
shorn of our illusions.

73
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,431
They show us what we'd look
like without our fine clothes.

74
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,200
How'd we smell without perfume.

75
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:16,339
Can I ask you about a personal matter?

76
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:18,107
Of course.

77
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,281
The king mentioned that
since your reunion,

78
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:26,583
you haven't joined him
in the marriage bed.

79
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
No.

80
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,255
You have a duty, Your Grace.

81
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:35,759
To your husband, your
king, your country,

82
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,194
to the gods themselves.

83
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,397
It's just...

84
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:44,734
the desires that once
drove me no longer do.

85
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,538
Congress does not require desire

86
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,909
on the woman's part, only patience.

87
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:55,878
The king must have an heir

88
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,615
if we are to continue our good work.

89
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,384
Forgive me.

90
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:04,120
Sometimes the true path is hard to find.

91
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,356
Hard to find

92
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,359
and harder still to walk upon.

93
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,928
But you've made great progress.

94
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:16,833
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead.

95
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,737
My grandmother?

96
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,238
Yes.

97
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:25,575
The Queen of Thorns is
a remarkable woman,

98
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:27,510
a strong woman,

99
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,346
and an unrepentant sinner.

100
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:32,315
You must teach her the new way

101
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,050
as she taught you the old.

102
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:37,153
Or I fear for her safety,

103
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,888
body and soul.

104
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,429
Does it move or talk?

105
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,998
I want to speak with you alone.

106
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,402
Septa Unella has been my
true friend and counselor.

107
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,171
Oh, this is madness!

108
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,080
You're not in your
sanctuary now, my dear.

109
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:07,917
All I have to do is whistle and my men
will stroll in here and bash you about...

110
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,119
- Grandmother.
- Until I tell them to stop.

111
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,622
If I tell them to stop.

112
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:16,125
- You could use a good bashing.
- Grandmother, please.

113
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:17,761
What have they done to you?

114
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,662
You marched against the High Sparrow,

115
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:21,664
- against the Faith.
- We marched for you.

116
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:24,501
The gods could have punished you
and Father, but they didn't.

117
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,603
- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

118
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,304
What mercy did they show him?

119
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:32,275
Loras's only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

120
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:35,478
If he does, the Faith will allow
him to return to Highgarden.

121
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,814
He'll have to renounce
his name and title...

122
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,683
- Have you lost your mind?
- And live his life as a penitent.

123
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:44,320
He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

124
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,855
He can begin again.

125
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:47,590
As a mindless fanatic.

126
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,526
As a free man.

127
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:53,162
You will leave for Highgarden today.

128
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:56,966
There is no law that
says you must stay here.

129
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:58,902
I am the queen.

130
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:02,972
It is my duty to serve
my husband the king.

131
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,878
But you should leave, Grandmother.

132
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Your place is at home.

133
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,483
I will never leave you. Never.

134
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,284
You must.

135
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:19,589
Go home.

136
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:23,593
Find comfort in prayer and good works.

137
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,765
The Mother watches over us all.

138
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,807
I'll see you soon, my dear.

139
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,748
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

140
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:59,028
Shall we pray?

141
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,214
We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,

142
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:20,483
when the time comes and we meant it,

143
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:22,351
but this isn't what we agreed to.

144
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:23,987
These aren't white walkers.

145
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:25,922
This isn't an army of the dead.

146
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:29,358
This isn't our fight.

147
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,328
If it weren't for him,
none of us would be here.

148
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,698
All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

149
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,101
And I'd be a pile of charred
bones just like Mance.

150
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,404
Remember Mance's camp?

151
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,073
It stretched all the way to the horizon.

152
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:46,208
And look at us now.

153
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,811
Look what's left of us.

154
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:51,414
And if we lose this, we're gone.

155
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:55,985
Dozens of tribes,
hundreds of generations.

156
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:58,220
Be like we were never there at all.

157
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:00,322
We'll be the last of the free folk.

158
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,928
That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

159
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:09,498
The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,

160
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,300
they know you're here.

161
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:14,303
They know that more than half
of you are women and children.

162
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:17,040
After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

163
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:19,776
You're right.

164
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:21,510
This isn't your fight.

165
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:24,146
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

166
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:25,748
I shouldn't be asking you.

167
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,617
It's not the deal we made.

168
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,588
I need you with me if
we're going to beat them,

169
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,791
and we need to beat them if
you're going to survive.

170
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:42,932
The crows killed him because
he spoke for the free folk

171
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:45,034
when no other southerners would.

172
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,805
He died for us.

173
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:53,309
If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

174
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,212
And if that's what we are,

175
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,915
we deserve to be the
last of the free folk.

176
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Snow.

177
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,111
Are you sure they'll come?

178
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:06,049
We're not clever like you southerners.

179
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:09,552
When we say we'll do
something, we do it.

180
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,905
I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

181
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:32,075
That is hardly your concern.

182
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,044
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

183
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:36,946
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

184
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:40,249
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

185
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:43,853
The High Sparrow rules
this city because of you.

186
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:48,290
Our two ancient houses face
collapse because of you

187
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,326
and your stupidity.

188
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,097
You're right.

189
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:56,132
I made a terrible mistake.

190
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:58,000
I carry it with me every single day.

191
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:59,602
Good.

192
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:03,239
I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

193
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,507
And now we must fight them together.

194
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,879
We need each other.

195
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,284
I wonder if you're the worst
person I've ever met.

196
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:18,187
At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

197
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:22,892
But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

198
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,161
Do you remember the
way you smirked at me

199
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:29,098
when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?

200
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,968
I do. I'll never forget it.

201
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,803
You love your granddaughter.

202
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:36,873
I love my son.

203
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,376
It's the only truth I know.

204
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,478
We must defend them.

205
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,848
I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can

206
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,019
before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

207
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,088
If you're half as bright
as you think you are,

208
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,856
you'll find a way out of here, too.

209
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,557
Never.

210
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,059
I'll never leave my son.

211
00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:59,128
What'll you do, then?

212
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,131
You have no support. Not anymore.

213
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,301
Your brother's gone. The
High Sparrow saw to that.

214
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:08,337
The rest of your family
have abandoned you.

215
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,306
The people despise you.

216
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,875
You're surrounded by
enemies, thousands of them.

217
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:14,944
You're going to kill
them all by yourself?

218
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:18,014
You've lost, Cersei.

219
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:22,151
It's the only joy I can
find in all this misery.

220
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,195
Pick the pace up.

221
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:33,762
Keep going.

222
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,836
Keep it moving!

223
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,806
Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.

224
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:21,543
Someone needs to teach those
sad twats how to dig trenches.

225
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:24,513
Someone certainly does.

226
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,250
Oh, no. Not me.

227
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:28,885
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

228
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:31,754
You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

229
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,689
Aye, knights don't get paid.

230
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,393
You have better instincts than any
officer in the Lannister army.

231
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:41,563
That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

232
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:46,735
I expect to command all the
Lannister forces before long.

233
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,871
You can be the right hand I lost.

234
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,511
You promised me a lordship and a castle

235
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:57,579
and a highborn beauty for a wife.

236
00:18:57,681 --> 00:19:00,182
And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always...

237
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,386
Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

238
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:25,374
Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

239
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:27,310
We have Lord Edmure.

240
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,981
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

241
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:53,535
This is your last warning.

242
00:19:53,637 --> 00:19:55,504
Yield the castle.

243
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,751
You think I won't do it, old man?

244
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:15,257
I sliced your niece's
throat from ear to ear.

245
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,295
And where were you? Running and
hiding like a fucking coward.

246
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,934
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

247
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,714
Go on, then. Cut his throat.

248
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,971
Lothar, is it?

249
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,274
Ser Jaime.

250
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:06,942
We didn't know you were coming.

251
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:08,710
'Cause you didn't set
a proper perimeter.

252
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,647
You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.

253
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:15,551
Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.

254
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,553
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

255
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:21,257
Walder.

256
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:26,562
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

257
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:32,068
Only a fool makes threats he's
not prepared to carry out.

258
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,937
Now let's say I threatened to hit you

259
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,606
unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.

260
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,176
- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's...

261
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,947
I'm here by the king's command
to take back this castle.

262
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:47,683
Have him bathed and fed.

263
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,352
Unless you'd like to take his place.

264
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,289
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

265
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:54,690
Do as he says.

266
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:57,193
The siege is now under my command.

267
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,895
The next time the Blackfish
looks out from those ramparts,

268
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,031
he'll see an army at his
gates, not whatever this is.

269
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,301
Have your lads start digging
perimeter trenches.

270
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,902
Set pickets every hundred yards.

271
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:09,538
And work double-time on those
siege towers and trebuchets.

272
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,973
Those are our siege towers...

273
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:13,542
As I said, the siege
is under my command.

274
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,212
If that's not to your liking, go home.

275
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,520
Get word to the Blackfish.

276
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:26,489
I want a parley.

277
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,491
A parley or a fight?

278
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,527
He's an old man.

279
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,395
You've got one hand.

280
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:35,598
My money's on the old boy.

281
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:57,452
Lady Mormont.

282
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,821
Welcome to Bear Island.

283
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:09,131
I remember when you were born, my lady.

284
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,966
You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

285
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,802
It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.

286
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:16,238
I doubt it. My mother
wasn't a great beauty

287
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,606
or any other kind of beauty.

288
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,875
She was a great warrior, though.

289
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:22,311
She died fighting for your brother Robb.

290
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,151
I served under your uncle at
Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

291
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:32,321
He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

292
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,056
I was his steward. In fact...

293
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:37,326
I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

294
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,498
Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black

295
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,100
before he marched on
Winterfell and was killed.

296
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:48,003
He showed me the letter you wrote
to him when he petitioned for men.

297
00:23:48,105 --> 00:23:50,005
- It said...
- I remember what it said.

298
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:51,607
Bear Island knows no king

299
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,376
but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

300
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:58,847
Robb is gone,

301
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:00,482
but House Stark is not.

302
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:03,752
And it needs your support
now more than ever.

303
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:07,923
I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.

304
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:21,002
As far as I understand, you're a Snow

305
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,904
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

306
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:25,073
Or is she a Lannister?

307
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:27,443
I've heard conflicting reports.

308
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:30,512
I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.

309
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:33,382
But I am a Stark. I
will always be a Stark.

310
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:35,984
If you say so. In any case,

311
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:38,954
you don't just want my allegiance.
You want my fighting men.

312
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:41,957
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

313
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,825
It is our duty to stop him.

314
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:48,230
Even more so because he holds our
brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

315
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,468
What you have to understand,
my lady, is that...

316
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,405
I understand that I'm responsible for
Bear Island and all who live here.

317
00:24:56,507 --> 00:25:01,042
So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?

318
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:10,152
If it please, my lady,

319
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:11,853
I understand how you feel.

320
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:14,390
I don't know you, Ser...?

321
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:16,492
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

322
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:19,194
You needn't ask your
maester about my house.

323
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:21,630
It's rather new.

324
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,701
All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

325
00:25:25,803 --> 00:25:27,770
How is it you understand how I feel?

326
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:32,608
You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.

327
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,244
Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.

328
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:38,113
I never thought I'd be in my position.

329
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:42,351
I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

330
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,520
And now I find myself
addressing the lady

331
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:46,789
of a great house in time of war.

332
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,092
But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.

333
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,363
It's our war.

334
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,433
Go on, Ser Davos.

335
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:01,804
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

336
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:03,806
made that man his steward.

337
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:06,709
He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew

338
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:08,811
he had the courage to do what was right,

339
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:11,847
even if it meant giving his life.

340
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:15,884
Because Jeor Mormont and
Jon Snow both understood

341
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:20,322
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

342
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:22,891
It's between the living and the dead.

343
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,962
And make no mistake, my lady,

344
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:29,030
the dead are coming.

345
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,368
Is this true?

346
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:37,072
Your uncle fought them at
the Fist of the First Men.

347
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:38,874
I fought them at Hardhome.

348
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,909
We both lost.

349
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:46,114
As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.

350
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:50,018
And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.

351
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:54,656
You want to protect your
people, my lady. I understand.

352
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,658
But there's no hiding from this.

353
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:00,763
We have to fight and we
need to do it together.

354
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:15,444
House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.

355
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:20,849
We will not break faith today.

356
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,723
Thank you, my lady.

357
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:31,026
How many fighting men can we expect?

358
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:38,967
62.

359
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,206
- 62?
- We are not a large house,

360
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,642
but we're a proud one.

361
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,477
And every man from Bear Island

362
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,946
fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.

363
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,616
If they're half as
ferocious as their lady,

364
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:56,952
the Boltons are doomed.

365
00:29:12,863 --> 00:29:14,496
Kingslayer.

366
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,399
Blackfish.

367
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,467
I assume you're here

368
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,970
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

369
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:25,373
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

370
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:28,243
- I don't have them.
- Pity.

371
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:31,179
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

372
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,815
Then why are you here?

373
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:35,651
You know why I'm here.

374
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:37,586
This castle belongs to House Frey.

375
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,220
You're trespassing.

376
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:42,090
In the name of King Tommen, I
order you to surrender or...

377
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:45,661
Or you'll kill Edmure?

378
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:48,496
My nephew's marked for
death no matter what.

379
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,032
Hang him and be done with it.

380
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,800
It won't stop with Edmure.

381
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:53,936
You'll force me to storm the castle.

382
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,837
Hundreds will die.

383
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,340
Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.

384
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:02,010
If you can breach the walls.

385
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:06,114
We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.

386
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,785
But if you surrender,

387
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,120
I'll spare the lives of your men.

388
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:13,889
On my honor.

389
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:15,591
Your honor?

390
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:18,927
Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

391
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:20,829
The war is over, ser.

392
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:23,599
Why sacrifice living
men to a lost cause?

393
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,408
As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

394
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:36,444
This is my home.

395
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:40,415
I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

396
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:43,384
So you can either attack

397
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:46,187
or try to starve us out.

398
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:49,057
We have enough provisions for two years.

399
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:54,596
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

400
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,804
You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

401
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:04,640
Why did you come treat with me?

402
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,043
Sieges are dull.

403
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:11,613
And I wanted to see you in
person, get the measure of you.

404
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:14,249
Well, now you have.

405
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:16,384
Aye, now I have.

406
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:18,954
I'm disappointed.

407
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,298
The answer is no.

408
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,535
- Lord Glover, if you could just
hear us out. - I've heard enough.

409
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:36,337
We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.

410
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,439
The Boltons helped us do it.

411
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,375
Now you want me to fight against them?

412
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:42,443
I could be skinned for
even talking to you.

413
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:44,813
The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton...

414
00:31:44,915 --> 00:31:47,983
Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

415
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:50,952
House Mormont.

416
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:52,988
And?

417
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,490
We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...

418
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:58,426
I don't care about ravens.

419
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:00,796
You're asking me to join your army.

420
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:04,232
Who is fighting in this army?

421
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:12,107
The bulk of the force is
made up of wildlings.

422
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:17,145
Then the rumors are true.

423
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:20,916
I didn't dare believe them.

424
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:27,689
I received you out of
respect for your father.

425
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,725
Now I would like you to leave.

426
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:33,128
House Glover will not
abandon its ancestral home

427
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,864
to fight alongside wildlings.

428
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,634
- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.

429
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:41,803
I would remind you that House Glover

430
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,905
is pledged to House Stark.

431
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,908
Sworn to answer when called upon.

432
00:32:56,954 --> 00:33:01,089
Yes, my family served House
Stark for centuries.

433
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:03,992
We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

434
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:08,563
When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call

435
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,799
and hailed him King in the North.

436
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,073
And where was King Robb

437
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:21,342
when the ironborn attacked this castle?

438
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:25,080
When they threw my wife
and children in prison

439
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:28,917
and brutalized and killed our subjects?

440
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,854
Taking up with a foreign whore.

441
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:36,825
Getting himself and those
who followed him killed.

442
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:44,032
I served House Stark once,

443
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:47,068
but House Stark is dead.

444
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:47,062
Why did we have to come here?

445
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,530
Some of us still like it.

446
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,770
Have a drink at least.

447
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:57,172
I don't want one.

448
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,077
Don't go far, love.

449
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:04,246
I'll find you in a bit.

450
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:12,653
Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.

451
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:15,357
Doesn't interest you anymore?

452
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,429
I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.

453
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,966
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

454
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,701
Don't you know that?

455
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:32,774
You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

456
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:36,411
Of course he is. As long as
we're alive, we're a threat.

457
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:38,146
He'll find us.

458
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:40,949
It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.

459
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:42,483
Drink.

460
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:43,985
I don't want any.

461
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:46,054
I don't care what you want. Drink.

462
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,126
Drink it all.

463
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:57,032
You're ironborn, Theon. I know
you've had some bad years.

464
00:35:57,134 --> 00:35:58,533
Some bad years?

465
00:35:58,635 --> 00:36:01,736
But I'm tired of watching
you cower like a beat dog.

466
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:04,105
Drink the goddamn ale.

467
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:10,145
Now listen to me.

468
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:11,579
I need you.

469
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:15,216
The real Theon Greyjoy, not
this rat shit pretender.

470
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:17,085
Can you find him for me?

471
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:19,955
Drink.

472
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:23,458
You escaped. You hear me?

473
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,094
You got away and you're
never going back.

474
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:28,163
We'll get justice for you.

475
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:30,898
If I got justice, my burnt body would
hang over the gates of Winterfell.

476
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:33,401
Fuck justice, then. We'll
get revenge. Drink.

477
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,375
Listen to me.

478
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:43,511
If you're so broken that
there's no coming back,

479
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,847
take a knife and cut your wrists.

480
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:49,351
End it.

481
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:53,321
But if you're staying,
Theon, I need you.

482
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:55,823
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

483
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:59,394
We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.

484
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:02,297
And we're gonna take
back the Iron Islands.

485
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:07,002
Are you with me?

486
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:10,271
Are you really with me?

487
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:31,726
Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,

488
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:33,861
I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.

489
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:49,244
Stannis camped here on
his way to Winterfell.

490
00:37:49,346 --> 00:37:51,679
And that's a good thing?

491
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:54,516
He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.

492
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:57,285
He chose this place for a reason.

493
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,787
Those mountains are a
natural fortification.

494
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:01,622
There's a stream down
there for the horses.

495
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,558
We're not staying here long.

496
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,460
Another storm could hit any day.

497
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:08,196
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis

498
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:10,231
as much as the Boltons did.

499
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:14,302
We have to march on Winterfell
now while we still can.

500
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:16,538
2,000 wildlings,

501
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,541
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

502
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:21,809
62 Mormonts.

503
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,844
It's not what we'd hoped for.

504
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:29,217
But we still have a chance
if we're careful and smart.

505
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:33,588
For fuck's sake.

506
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:39,294
So he's your most trusted advisor now?

507
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:42,597
Because he secured 62
men from a 10-year-old?

508
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:45,300
Ser Davos is the reason I'm
standing here talking to you

509
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:47,569
and he served Stannis for years.

510
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,305
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

511
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:53,808
who murdered his own brother,
who doesn't have a head?

512
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,645
It's not enough. We need more men.

513
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,172
There's no time.

514
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:01,617
If we went down to Castle
Cerwyn, I know that Lord...

515
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,306
We fight with the army we have.

516
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,524
Friends, this is not worth fighting over!

517
00:39:11,694 --> 00:39:13,027
This'll be it, now.

518
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,663
Right, now we don't
need to be fighting...

519
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:16,671
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.

520
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,183
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

521
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,880
I was a soldier once.

522
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:08,949
All my superiors thought I was brave.

523
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:12,119
I wasn't. I mean, I
never ran from a fight.

524
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:15,756
Only because I was afraid my
friends would see I was afraid.

525
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:17,758
That's all I was, a coward.

526
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,729
We followed orders no matter the orders.

527
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:24,365
Burn that village.

528
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,801
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

529
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:29,571
Steal that farmer's crops.
Good, I'm your thief.

530
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:33,374
Kill those young lads so they
won't take up arms against us.

531
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,444
I'm your murderer.

532
00:40:37,814 --> 00:40:40,715
I remember once a woman screaming at us,

533
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:45,286
calling us animals as we dragged
her son from their hut.

534
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:47,555
But we weren't animals.

535
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:50,157
Animals are true to their nature

536
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,594
and we had betrayed ours.

537
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:58,032
I cut that young boy's throat myself

538
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:00,034
as his mother screamed

539
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:02,069
and my friends held her back.

540
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:06,974
That night...

541
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:11,312
I felt such shame.

542
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:14,315
Shame was so heavy on me,

543
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:17,852
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

544
00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:20,722
All I could do was stare
into that dark sky

545
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:24,325
and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.

546
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:32,734
I'll hear her screaming
the rest of my life.

547
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:38,973
Now, I know I can never
bring that lad back.

548
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:41,409
All I can do with time I've got left

549
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:43,844
is bring a little
goodness into the world.

550
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:46,013
That's all any of us can do, isn't it?

551
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:48,683
Never too late to stop robbing people,

552
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:50,618
to stop killing people.

553
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,588
Start helping people.

554
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,190
It's never too late to come back.

555
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:14,008
And it's not about waiting for
the gods to answer your prayers.

556
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,478
It's not even about the gods.
It's about you.

557
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,848
Learning you have to answer
your prayers yourself.

558
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,387
Seven save you, friends.

559
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:29,290
How can we help you?

560
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,329
What are you doing here?

561
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:37,298
Well, we're talking about life.

562
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
You?

563
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:40,267
Protecting the people.

564
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,938
Well, we thank you for your protection.

565
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,273
Who are you protecting us from?

566
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:50,411
Do you have any horses?

567
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,347
No horses.

568
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,483
No gold. No steel.

569
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:59,220
Food, then. Protecting the
people is hungry work.

570
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:01,422
I'm sure it is.

571
00:43:01,524 --> 00:43:02,923
You're welcome to stay for supper,

572
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,593
but we have hungry mouths here.

573
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:15,403
Stay safe.

574
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:17,538
The night is dark and full of terrors.

575
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:44,432
"Seven save you, friends."

576
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:47,001
I'm a fucking septon. What
was I supposed to say?

577
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:48,870
They don't believe in your Seven.

578
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,272
They're from the Brotherhood.
They follow the Red God.

579
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:53,508
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

580
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,376
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

581
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:57,011
Sure, you do. You've got food,

582
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:59,680
you've got steel even
if you say you don't.

583
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,148
And you've got women.

584
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,918
What do you want to do? Fight them?

585
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,787
Kill them?

586
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:07,354
It'd be you against all of them.

587
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,924
I mean, these people
don't know how to fight.

588
00:44:10,026 --> 00:44:11,225
You do.

589
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,961
I'm done with fighting.

590
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:16,063
Even if it's to protect yourself?

591
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:18,733
Violence is a disease.

592
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:22,002
You don't cure a disease by
spreading it to more people.

593
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:25,473
You don't cure it by dying, either.

594
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,143
You've done enough work for one day.

595
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:31,946
Come on up for some supper.

596
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:34,248
It's gonna be a cold night.

597
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,350
We'll need firewood.

598
00:44:36,453 --> 00:44:38,886
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

599
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:40,988
Might even have some ale hidden away.

600
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:51,231
He's not a lying man.

601
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:53,501
He says the Iron Fleet's
in Slaver's Bay.

602
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,202
I'm inclined to believe him.

603
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:58,072
I'm not going anywhere
near those mad fuckers.

604
00:44:58,174 --> 00:45:00,107
You're Westerosi.

605
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:01,642
What do you care?

606
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:03,744
I want to book passage home.

607
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:06,914
You? Can't afford it.

608
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,381
Where'd you steal this from?

609
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:16,726
Why do you care?

610
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:20,361
We leave in two days.

611
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:22,162
You can have a hammock in steerage.

612
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:26,133
I want a cabin.

613
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:28,168
And we'll leave at dawn.

614
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:31,305
See you at sunrise.

615
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:53,728
Sweet girl.
