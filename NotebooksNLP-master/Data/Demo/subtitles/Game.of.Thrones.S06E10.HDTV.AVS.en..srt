1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Weak men will never rule Dorne again.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Riverrun is ours.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

4
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Take that castle back.

5
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
He'll never yield, father.

6
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
You'll remind him who
it was that got married

7
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
at the Red Wedding in the first place.

8
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Command all the forces within the castle

9
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
to lay down their arms. Open the gates.

10
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Your aunt Lyanna...

11
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
She was already promised
to Robert Baratheon.

12
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Father never talked about her.

13
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
How many tens of thousands had to die

14
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
because Rhaegar chose your aunt.

15
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

16
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
We need friends in Westeros,
and we need ships.

17
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

18
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

19
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Our fathers were evil men.

20
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
They left the world worse
than they found it.

21
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

22
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Your reign is over.

23
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
My reign has just begun.

24
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
You've made great progress.

25
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead,

26
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
or I fear for her safety.

27
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Go home. Find comfort in
prayer and good works.

28
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
The Mother watches over us all.

29
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
After conferring with His
Holiness, the High Septon,

30
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
we have determined that trial by combat

31
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
will be forbidden throughout
the Seven Kingdoms.

32
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

33
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
will stand trial before seven septons

34
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:01,800
as it was in the earliest
days of the faith.

35
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,466
Your Grace.

36
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:24,203
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

37
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,120
You got my money?

38
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,522
Later. Go away.

39
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:13,088
Grand Maester.

40
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,964
Ser Loras Tyrell.

41
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,534
Are you prepared to stand trial

42
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:04,338
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

43
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:09,343
There'll be no need for a trial.

44
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,249
I confess before the Seven

45
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,350
and freely admit to my crimes.

46
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:20,588
To which crimes will you be confessing?

47
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,024
All of them.

48
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,460
I lay with other men

49
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:29,998
including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

50
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:36,271
I perjured myself before the gods.

51
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,673
I am guilty of depravity...

52
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,177
dishonesty,

53
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,744
profligacy,

54
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,714
and arrogance.

55
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,249
I see that now.

56
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,854
I humble myself before the Seven

57
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:56,357
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

58
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:03,264
The gods' judgment is fierce,

59
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,900
but also fair.

60
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:09,370
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

61
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,739
beyond the reach of justice.

62
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:16,311
But the Mother shows her mercy

63
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:20,215
to those who kneel before her.

64
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,959
I take full responsibility
for my many sins

65
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,561
and unburden myself of my desires.

66
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,968
My only remaining wish

67
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,670
is to devote my life to the Seven.

68
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,840
May I be a living example of their grace

69
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,609
for others to witness.

70
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,647
You understand fully

71
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,583
what this means?

72
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,185
I do.

73
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,890
I will abandon the Tyrell name

74
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:05,026
and all that goes with it.

75
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:08,897
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

76
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,769
I will never marry

77
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,272
and I will never father children.

78
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,810
Brother Loras...

79
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,681
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

80
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,722
Will you fight to defend your faith

81
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,258
against heretics and apostates?

82
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,859
I will.

83
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,223
No, I can't let them...

84
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:12,293
Faith is the way, Father.

85
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:36,017
All right.

86
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,953
I'm ready.

87
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,896
I have to go. I'm...

88
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,931
I'm late for the trial.

89
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,180
You mutilated him.

90
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:08,182
You gave me your word.

91
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,651
And I have kept my word.

92
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,521
Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,

93
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,656
Brother Loras is free to leave.

94
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,658
And where is the queen mother?

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,029
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

96
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:25,066
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

97
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,138
Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

98
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,766
Get the others.

99
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,743
Where's the king?

100
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,648
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

101
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,383
What's the meaning of this?

102
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,352
I was told that...

103
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:55,123
I have more important
things to do with my time

104
00:11:55,225 --> 00:11:56,591
than waste them in the presence...

105
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,360
Please, Grand Maester. I
bear you no ill will.

106
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,164
Please forgive me if you can.

107
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,064
This pains me, my lord.

108
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,233
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve

109
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:42,303
to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

110
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:46,140
But sometimes before we
can usher in the new,

111
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:50,378
the old must be put to rest.

112
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:34,655
The longer you wait, the
worse it'll be for you.

113
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,651
What are you doing?

114
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,086
There's something wrong.

115
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:15,656
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

116
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,625
The trial will begin shortly.

117
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,428
Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.

118
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,862
Why do you think they're not here?

119
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,798
If the accused is not here,

120
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:25,966
she will be tried regardless.

121
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,302
We cannot escape the
justice of the gods...

122
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:31,038
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you!

123
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,575
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

124
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,444
and she is absent anyway,

125
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:40,414
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

126
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:44,385
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

127
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,279
We all need to leave now!

128
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,687
Loras.

129
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,955
Stay with me.

130
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:37,204
Let me through. Let me through.

131
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:41,375
Get out of my way.

132
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,619
Let us through.

133
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,110
Confess.

134
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,247
Confess.

135
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,587
- No.
- Confess.

136
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:46,033
Confess. It felt good.

137
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:49,837
Beating me, starving me,

138
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,840
frightening me, humiliating me.

139
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:59,500
You didn't do it because you
cared about my atonement.

140
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:02,658
You did it because it felt good.

141
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,023
I understand.

142
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:07,454
I do things because they feel good.

143
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:13,761
I drink because it feels good.

144
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:17,965
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

145
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:26,273
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

146
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,442
I lie about fucking my brother...

147
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:34,481
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

148
00:19:37,286 --> 00:19:39,053
I killed your High Sparrow...

149
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,190
and all his little sparrows...

150
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,128
all his septons, all his septas,

151
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,065
all his filthy soldiers,

152
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,367
because it felt good to watch them burn.

153
00:19:56,205 --> 00:20:00,040
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

154
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:03,477
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

155
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:12,686
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

156
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,894
You've always been quiet.

157
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,839
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

158
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:34,008
Do you remember?

159
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,076
Good.

160
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:40,614
I'm glad to see your face.

161
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,452
I'm ready to meet the gods.

162
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:46,887
What?

163
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,824
Now?

164
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:52,392
Today?

165
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,898
You're not going to die today.

166
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:02,870
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

167
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,274
Ser Gregor.

168
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,580
This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

169
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:16,283
He's quiet, too.

170
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:29,029
Your gods have forsaken you.

171
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:32,399
This is your god now.

172
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,412
No.

173
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,681
No.

174
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:52,452
Shame.

175
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:55,789
Shame.

176
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:59,593
Shame.

177
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

178
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,303
Very sorry.

179
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,449
For House Lannister!

180
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,485
Hear me roar!

181
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:06,326
For House Frey!

182
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,496
We stand together!

183
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,465
May we stand together
through the centuries,

184
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,035
good friends to the last.

185
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:19,173
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

186
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:23,076
may we speak the words of our alliance,

187
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,579
"The Freys and the Lannisters

188
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,882
send their regards."

189
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,702
You don't even have to
do anything, do you?

190
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:52,372
You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,

191
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,907
and all the birds come pecking.

192
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:56,409
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

193
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,912
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

194
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:02,883
Those two have their eyes on you.

195
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:06,953
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

196
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:08,655
Not my type.

197
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:10,324
Not blonde enough?

198
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:16,230
Ladies, have you met Ser
Bronn of the Blackwater,

199
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,498
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

200
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,968
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

201
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:25,874
Fuck it.

202
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:29,042
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

203
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,783
This came together rather well.

204
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,687
Your father would be pleased.

205
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,455
I'm sure he would be.

206
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:47,928
Edmure is back in a cell.

207
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,664
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

208
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,934
Give the family a bad name.

209
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:01,341
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

210
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:04,344
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

211
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:08,115
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

212
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,750
I'm a bit old for all that.

213
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:13,553
No, but back in your day.

214
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:16,589
The purpose of fighting

215
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:19,893
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

216
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:21,995
I've defeated mine.

217
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:25,799
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

218
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,467
Now it's mine.

219
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,869
What do you call that?

220
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:31,238
Victory.

221
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,840
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

222
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:39,212
Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

223
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:42,049
The Tullys mocked me for years.

224
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,318
The Starks mocked me.

225
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,885
Where are they now?

226
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:48,455
You talk about war as
if you're an expert,

227
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:50,857
but the one battle I
remember you fighting,

228
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,860
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

229
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:56,863
But it doesn't matter.

230
00:25:56,966 --> 00:26:00,300
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

231
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:04,271
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

232
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:07,374
and snigger behind our backs.

233
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,042
We don't mind, do we?

234
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:13,113
Fear is a marvelous thing.

235
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,814
They don't fear the Freys, though.

236
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,650
They fear the Lannisters.

237
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:20,120
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

238
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,655
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

239
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,158
every time you lose them,

240
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,227
why do we need you?

241
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,583
Show me.

242
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:55,355
Your Grace, there's no need...

243
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:56,823
Show me.

244
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:13,140
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

245
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:15,909
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

246
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,779
perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

247
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,384
He should be with his grandfather,

248
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:27,320
his brother, his sister.

249
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:32,426
Burn him

250
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,495
and bury his ashes where
the sept once stood.

251
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:34,588
Hello.

252
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:45,064
From Lord Commander
Snow at Castle Black.

253
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:01,948
I'm...

254
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,550
I'm to be the new maester.

255
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:22,536
According to our records,

256
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:24,404
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

257
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,541
He died.

258
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,210
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

259
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,446
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

260
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:35,815
He's since passed away.

261
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,018
Jon Snow will go to

262
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,952
Which is why I'm here.

263
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,158
This is irregular.

264
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,294
Yes, well...

265
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,264
I suppose that life is irregular.

266
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,612
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

267
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,218
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

268
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,186
Follow me.

269
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:18,157
No women or children.

270
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,708
When we had feasts,

271
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,076
our family would sit up here...

272
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,980
and I'd sit down there.

273
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,885
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

274
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,754
You had a family.

275
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:29,021
You had feasts.

276
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:34,327
Aye, you're right. I
was luckier than most.

277
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:51,444
What is that?

278
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:55,014
Tell him.

279
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:00,253
Tell him who it belonged to.

280
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:06,726
The Princess Shireen.

281
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:09,128
Tell him what you did to her.

282
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:12,598
Tell him!

283
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,707
We burned her at the stake.

284
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:36,188
Why?

285
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:39,392
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

286
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:42,562
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

287
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:44,096
I only do what my Lord commands.

288
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:47,333
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

289
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:52,338
We are standing here because of him.

290
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:57,109
Jon Snow is alive because
the Lord willed it.

291
00:33:57,211 --> 00:34:00,814
I loved that girl like she was my own.

292
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,216
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

293
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,887
So did her father.

294
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,658
So did her mother.

295
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:16,095
Her own blood knew it was the only way.

296
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:18,798
The only way for what?

297
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,599
They all died anyway.

298
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,270
You told everyone Stannis was the one.

299
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:26,706
You had him believing
it, all of them fooled.

300
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:29,275
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

301
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:32,345
I was wrong.

302
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,682
Aye, you were wrong.

303
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,418
How many died because you were wrong?

304
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:48,294
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

305
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:50,196
She admits to the crime.

306
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:55,101
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

307
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,706
I've been ready to die for many years.

308
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,544
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

309
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,847
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

310
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:11,217
You know the great war is still to come.

311
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,286
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

312
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:18,090
And you know I can
help you win that war.

313
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,240
Ride south today.

314
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,644
If you return to the North,

315
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:40,346
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

316
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,700
If you ever come back this way,

317
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:03,169
I will execute you myself.

318
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:37,971
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

319
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,741
Mother and Father's room?

320
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,044
You should take it.

321
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:48,414
I'm not a Stark.

322
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:50,917
You are to me.

323
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,255
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

324
00:36:56,357 --> 00:37:00,259
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

325
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:03,863
The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.

326
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:06,165
They came because of you.

327
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,106
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

328
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,974
- He did.
- And you trust him?

329
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,711
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

330
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,617
I should have told you about him,

331
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,054
about the Knights of the Vale.

332
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,622
I'm sorry.

333
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,902
We need to trust each other.

334
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,005
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

335
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:48,607
We have so many enemies now.

336
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:06,893
Jon.

337
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:10,429
A raven came from the Citadel.

338
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,431
A white raven.

339
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,669
Winter is here.

340
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,085
Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

341
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:49,335
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

342
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:51,537
he was assassinated.

343
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,207
100 red scorpions, was it?

344
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:56,809
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

345
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:59,045
You murder your own prince,

346
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:00,880
but you expect me to trust you?

347
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:03,950
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

348
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,318
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

349
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,905
What is your name again?

350
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:11,309
Barbaro?

351
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,091
Obara.

352
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:15,327
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

353
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:18,064
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

354
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,500
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

355
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:25,104
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

356
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:27,106
No? Good.

357
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,608
Let the grown women speak.

358
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:33,412
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

359
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:36,482
They have declared war on Dorne.

360
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:40,219
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

361
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:44,490
Cersei stole the future from me.

362
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,358
She killed my son.

363
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,494
She killed my grandson.

364
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:51,798
She killed my granddaughter.

365
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,733
Survival is not what I'm after now.

366
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:57,003
You're absolutely right.

367
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,672
I chose the wrong words.

368
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,275
It is not survival I offer.

369
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:04,710
It is your heart's desire.

370
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:09,748
And what is my heart's desire?

371
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,552
Vengeance.

372
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:14,753
Justice.

373
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:20,359
Fire and blood.

374
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:29,635
Your ships are nearly ready.

375
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:32,038
I saw them painting the sails.

376
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,475
!T!U!S!U!B!T!I!T!U!L!O!C!O!M!

377
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:39,278
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

378
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,280
You're not coming with us.

379
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,886
New strategy?

380
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:50,189
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

381
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,892
If we take Casterly Rock,

382
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:56,562
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

383
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,597
You're not going to Westeros.

384
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:01,633
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

385
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:04,370
There's finally peace in Meereen.

386
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:07,806
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

387
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,910
Fuck Meereen.

388
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,912
Fuck the people.

389
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:15,281
I'm here for you, not them.

390
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:17,049
You promised me.

391
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:20,086
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

392
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:23,289
This is what I command.

393
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:26,392
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

394
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:28,995
I'll need to make alliances.

395
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:32,464
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

396
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:37,636
Who are you marrying this time?

397
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:41,107
I don't know. Maybe no one.

398
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:44,310
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

399
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,379
Are you a queen or fish bait?

400
00:41:48,816 --> 00:41:51,784
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

401
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:54,120
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

402
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:57,123
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

403
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:00,526
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

404
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:02,728
sits beside you in the throne room.

405
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,864
I don't want a crown. I want you.

406
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,041
I love you.

407
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:17,609
And I make you happy.

408
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,578
You know I do.

409
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:25,517
Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

410
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:34,393
I can't.

411
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:45,871
The dwarf told you to do this?

412
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:47,639
No one tells me to do anything.

413
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:50,909
Clever fellow. Can't
argue with his logic.

414
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:52,744
I'm no use to you over there.

415
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:54,113
Don't get angry.

416
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:57,383
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

417
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:59,085
Who comes after you?

418
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:02,355
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

419
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,723
A great number of women, I imagine.

420
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:12,764
Specific orders will be left for you

421
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:15,801
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

422
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,703
Bay of Dragons?

423
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:20,806
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

424
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:27,113
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

425
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,649
I hope it brings you happiness.

426
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:38,324
I pity the lords of Westeros.

427
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:40,592
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

428
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:44,630
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

429
00:44:03,317 --> 00:44:05,617
How did he take it?

430
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:07,786
No tears.

431
00:44:09,857 --> 00:44:12,491
I know it was hard for you.

432
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:14,626
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

433
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:17,629
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

434
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:23,902
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

435
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:26,172
if it's any consolation.

436
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:30,876
It's not.

437
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:33,279
No, I suppose not.

438
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:34,913
I'm terrible at consoling.

439
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:37,316
Yes, you really are.

440
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:44,690
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

441
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:49,061
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

442
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:51,163
you have your dragons.

443
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:53,232
Everything you've ever wanted

444
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:56,235
since you were old
enough to want anything,

445
00:44:56,337 --> 00:44:58,204
it's all yours for the taking.

446
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:01,907
Are you afraid?

447
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,945
Good.

448
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:09,781
You're in the great game now.

449
00:45:09,883 --> 00:45:12,451
And the great game's terrifying.

450
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:15,020
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

451
00:45:15,123 --> 00:45:17,223
are madmen like your father.

452
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:21,427
Do you know what frightens me?

453
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:25,564
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

454
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:31,003
A man I thought I cared for.

455
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,071
And I felt nothing.

456
00:45:34,675 --> 00:45:36,575
Just impatient to get on with it.

457
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,748
He wasn't the first to love you

458
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,916
and he won't be the last.

459
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:53,725
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

460
00:45:56,297 --> 00:46:01,100
For what it's worth, I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

461
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:03,902
Everyone's always asking
me to believe in things...

462
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:07,739
family, gods, kings, myself.

463
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:09,675
It was often tempting

464
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:12,110
until I saw where belief got people.

465
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:16,081
So I said no, thank you to belief.

466
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:19,485
And yet here I am.

467
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,456
I believe in you.

468
00:46:26,394 --> 00:46:28,794
It's embarrassing, really.

469
00:46:30,864 --> 00:46:32,665
I'd swear you my sword,

470
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:35,801
but I don't actually own a sword.

471
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:37,903
It's your counsel I need.

472
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,439
It's yours.

473
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,973
Now and always.

474
00:46:43,477 --> 00:46:45,311
Good.

475
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:48,647
I...

476
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:50,516
I had something made for you.

477
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,753
I'm not sure if it's right.

478
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:06,765
Tyrion Lannister,

479
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,767
I name you Hand of the Queen.

480
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:45,537
You're not one of mine, are you?

481
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,139
No, my lord.

482
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:48,907
Didn't think so.

483
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,243
Too pretty.

484
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:58,317
Where are my damn moron sons?!

485
00:47:58,419 --> 00:48:02,154
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

486
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:04,089
They're here, my lord.

487
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:07,493
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

488
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:09,662
Tell them to come here now.

489
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:12,030
But they're already here, my lord.

490
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:19,070
Here, my lord.

491
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,391
They weren't easy to carve.

492
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:42,961
Especially Black Walder.

493
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:45,931
What...

494
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,707
My name is Arya Stark.

495
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:56,308
I want you to know that.

496
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,144
The last thing you're ever going to see

497
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:01,980
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

498
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:58,771
Forgive me, my lady...

499
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:03,208
if you're at prayer.

500
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,310
I'm done with all that.

501
00:50:07,515 --> 00:50:10,048
I came here every day when I was a girl.

502
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:14,586
I prayed to be somewhere else.

503
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:18,391
Back then I only thought about what I
wanted, never about what I had.

504
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:23,929
I was a stupid girl.

505
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:25,964
You were a child.

506
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:31,737
What do you want?

507
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,205
I thought you knew what I wanted.

508
00:50:34,308 --> 00:50:35,908
I was wrong.

509
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:38,677
No, you weren't.

510
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:42,981
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

511
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,317
I close my eyes and
see the same picture.

512
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,422
Whenever I consider an
action, I ask myself

513
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:54,660
will this action help to
make this picture a reality?

514
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,397
Pull it out of my mind

515
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,333
and into the world?

516
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:06,404
And I only act if the answer is yes.

517
00:51:09,176 --> 00:51:12,203
A picture of me...

518
00:51:12,204 --> 00:51:14,945
on the Iron Throne...

519
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,450
and you by my side.

520
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:30,428
It's a pretty picture.

521
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,471
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

522
00:51:39,573 --> 00:51:43,074
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

523
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:45,644
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

524
00:51:45,746 --> 00:51:48,446
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

525
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:50,749
The past is gone for good.

526
00:51:50,851 --> 00:51:52,918
You can sit here mourning its departure

527
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,954
or you can prepare for the future.

528
00:51:56,056 --> 00:51:58,524
You, my love,

529
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:01,259
are the future of House Stark.

530
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:05,030
Who should the North rally behind?

531
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:07,833
A trueborn daughter of
Ned and Catelyn Stark

532
00:52:07,935 --> 00:52:09,835
born here at Winterfell

533
00:52:09,937 --> 00:52:13,138
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

534
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,833
This is where I leave you.

535
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:43,735
You're not coming with us?

536
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:48,607
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

537
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:51,877
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

538
00:52:53,681 --> 00:52:55,747
Strong magic

539
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:58,984
to protect men from what lies beyond.

540
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:02,921
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

541
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:04,022
I cannot pass.

542
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:22,674
Where will you go?

543
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:24,309
The great war is coming

544
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:27,212
and I still fight for the living.

545
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:31,382
I'll do what I can...

546
00:53:32,753 --> 00:53:34,953
as long as I can.

547
00:53:38,859 --> 00:53:40,959
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

548
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:43,394
I wish you both good fortune.

549
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,203
Are you sure you're ready for this?

550
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:28,406
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.

551
00:54:28,508 --> 00:54:30,742
I have to be ready for this.

552
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:06,978
Ned?

553
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:09,581
Lyanna.

554
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:11,783
Is that you?

555
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:17,555
Is that really you?

556
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:24,395
You're not a dream?

557
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:27,632
No, I'm not a dream.

558
00:55:29,302 --> 00:55:31,169
I'm here.

559
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,606
Right here.

560
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,042
I've missed you, big brother.

561
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,380
I've missed you, too.

562
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,620
I want to be brave.

563
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:53,759
You are.

564
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:56,594
I'm not.

565
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,566
I don't want to die.

566
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:03,902
You're not going to die.

567
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:09,540
Get her some water!

568
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:11,943
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

569
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:14,379
Listen to me, Ned.

570
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,370
_

571
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:23,521
If Robert finds out, he'll...

572
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:25,490
you know he will.

573
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:27,458
You have to protect him.

574
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,430
Promise me, Ned.

575
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:36,701
Promise me.

576
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,816
Promise me, Ned.

577
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:57,088
Promise me.

578
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:30,555
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

579
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,291
to side with wildling invaders.

580
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:37,329
We didn't invade. We were invited.

581
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,130
Not by me.

582
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:41,032
The free folk, the northerners,

583
00:57:41,134 --> 00:57:43,501
and the Knights of the
Vale fought bravely,

584
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:45,904
fought together, and we won.

585
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:50,742
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

586
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:53,444
The Boltons are defeated.

587
00:57:53,546 --> 00:57:55,480
The war is over.

588
00:57:55,582 --> 00:57:57,482
Winter has come.

589
00:57:57,584 --> 00:58:01,086
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

590
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:04,622
We should ride home and
wait out the coming storms.

591
00:58:04,724 --> 00:58:06,824
The war is not over.

592
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:08,960
And I promise you, friend,

593
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:11,997
the true enemy won't wait out the storm.

594
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:13,598
He brings the storm.

595
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:37,655
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

596
00:58:37,757 --> 00:58:39,590
but you refused the call.

597
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,931
You swore allegiance to
House Stark, Lord Glover,

598
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:48,633
but in their hour of greatest need,

599
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:50,735
you refused the call.

600
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:54,872
And you, Lord Cerwyn,

601
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:58,843
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

602
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:01,413
Still you refused the call.

603
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:08,386
But House Mormont remembers.

604
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:11,189
The North remembers.

605
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:15,860
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

606
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,397
I don't care if he's a bastard.

607
00:59:19,499 --> 00:59:22,100
Ned Stark's blood runs
through his veins.

608
00:59:22,202 --> 00:59:26,671
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

609
00:59:43,357 --> 00:59:45,923
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

610
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:47,325
and truly.

611
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,833
My son died for Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

612
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:59,004
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

613
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:01,539
I didn't commit my men to your cause

614
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,275
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

615
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:08,013
But I was wrong.

616
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,953
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

617
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:18,456
He is the White Wolf.

618
01:00:18,558 --> 01:00:21,493
The King in the North.

619
01:00:28,968 --> 01:00:31,436
I did not fight beside you on the field

620
01:00:31,538 --> 01:00:34,972
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

621
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,710
A man can only admit when he was wrong

622
01:00:39,812 --> 01:00:41,379
and ask forgiveness.

623
01:00:44,384 --> 01:00:46,684
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

624
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:51,789
There will be more fights to come.

625
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:55,427
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

626
01:00:55,529 --> 01:00:57,828
as we have for a thousand years.

627
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:01,899
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

628
01:01:04,337 --> 01:01:06,404
the King in the North!

629
01:01:08,308 --> 01:01:11,209
The King in the North!

630
01:01:11,311 --> 01:01:52,872
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

631
01:01:54,787 --> 01:01:56,787
Company halt!

632
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:01,259
Halt!

633
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:05,263
Halt!

634
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,242
Come on.

635
01:03:12,932 --> 01:03:16,701
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

636
01:03:16,803 --> 01:03:19,437
First of Her Name,

637
01:03:19,539 --> 01:03:22,907
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

638
01:03:23,009 --> 01:03:26,211
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

639
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:14,125
Long may she reign.

640
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:16,394
Long may she reign.
