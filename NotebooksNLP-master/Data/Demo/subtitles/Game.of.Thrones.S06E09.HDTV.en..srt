2
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:33,179
Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

3
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:38,351
Perhaps we should take shelter.

4
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:41,654
The city's on the rise?

5
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,523
Meereen is strong.

6
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,492
Commerce has returned to the markets.

7
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,128
The people are behind you.

8
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,931
Well, not all the people, of course.

9
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:55,101
No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

10
00:02:55,203 --> 00:02:59,539
But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.

11
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:03,876
The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.

12
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:07,180
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

13
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,483
a city without Masters...

14
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:13,253
...it proves that no one needs a Master.

15
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,091
Good.

16
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:20,060
Shall we begin?

17
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,363
Do we have a plan?

18
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:25,432
I will crucify the Masters.

19
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:27,300
I will set their fleets afire,

20
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,202
kill every last one of their soldiers,

21
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,404
and return their cities to the dirt.

22
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:33,873
That is my plan.

23
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,710
You don't approve?

24
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,146
You once told me you knew
what your father was.

25
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:42,882
Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

26
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,351
when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

27
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,656
Probably not.

28
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,093
Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

29
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:56,829
He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,

30
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,432
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,

31
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,534
all the major thoroughfares.

32
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,738
He would have burned every
one of his citizens.

33
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,174
The loyal ones and the traitors.

34
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:10,577
Every man, woman, and child.

35
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:12,112
That's why Jaime killed him.

36
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:13,480
This is entirely different.

37
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,615
You're talking about destroying cities.

38
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,817
It's not entirely different.

39
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:25,158
I'd like to suggest an
alternate approach.

40
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,073
Once before, I offered you peace.

41
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:43,543
If you had not been so arrogant,

42
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:47,580
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

43
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:54,262
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

44
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,955
like the beggar queen you are.

45
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:59,125
We are here to discuss
terms of surrender,

46
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:01,594
not to trade insults.

47
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:03,596
The terms are simple.

48
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:08,835
You and your foreign friends will abandon
the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.

49
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:11,337
The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz

50
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,340
will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

51
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,477
The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain

52
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,912
to be sold again to the highest bidder.

53
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:23,883
The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

54
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,853
We obviously didn't communicate clearly.

55
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,823
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

56
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:36,663
I imagine it's difficult

57
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:39,332
adjusting to the new reality.

58
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,970
Your reign is over.

59
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,376
My reign has just begun.

60
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,569
Dracarys.

61
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,181
Your men have a choice:

62
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:23,183
fight and die for masters who would
never fight and die for you,

63
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,968
or go home to your families.

64
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,334
Thank you for the armada.

65
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:37,202
Our queen does love ships.

66
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:42,341
Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.

67
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,544
You violated that pact.

68
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,312
You declared war upon us.

69
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,681
Though our queen does
have a forgiving nature,

70
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:51,984
this cannot be forgiven.

71
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:54,954
Our queen insists that
one of you must die

72
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,457
as punishment for your crimes.

73
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:02,061
It always seems a bit
abstract, doesn't it,

74
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:03,930
other people dying?

75
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,800
Him. He should die.

76
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,169
Yes, him. He's not one of us.

77
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,838
He's an outsider, a lowborn.

78
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,940
He does not speak for us.

79
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,078
Please.

80
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,281
Please.

81
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:43,302
Tell your people what happened here.

82
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,140
Tell them you live by the
grace of Her Majesty.

83
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:50,376
When they come forward with
notions of retribution

84
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:54,881
or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

85
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:57,082
remind them what happened

86
00:10:57,184 --> 00:11:00,820
when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

87
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,624
You don't have to be here.

88
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:40,760
Yes, I do.

89
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:07,453
My beloved wife.

90
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,891
I've missed you terribly.

91
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:18,464
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

92
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:21,266
Now, dismount and kneel before me,

93
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:26,473
surrender your army and proclaim me the true
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

94
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,440
I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

95
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:32,544
I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

96
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:38,150
Come, bastard,

97
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:41,053
you don't have the men, you
don't have the horses,

98
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:43,355
and you don't have Winterfell.

99
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:47,093
Why lead those poor
souls into slaughter?

100
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:49,895
There's no need for a battle.

101
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,932
Get off your horse and kneel.

102
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,636
I'm a man of mercy.

103
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,342
You're right.

104
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,577
There's no need for a battle.

105
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:09,749
Thousands of men don't need to die.

106
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:13,452
Only one of us.

107
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,823
Let's end this the old way.

108
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,992
You against me.

109
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:35,274
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

110
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,509
The way people in the
North talk about you,

111
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:39,879
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

112
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,382
Maybe you are that good.

113
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:45,584
Maybe not.

114
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:48,220
I don't know if I'd beat you.

115
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:51,490
But I know that my army will beat yours.

116
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,693
I have 6,000 men.

117
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:57,782
You have, what, half that?

118
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:58,664
Not even?

119
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,800
Aye, you have the numbers.

120
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,736
Will your men want to fight for you

121
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:06,739
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

122
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,416
He's good. Very good.

123
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,453
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

124
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:23,756
because you're too proud to surrender?

125
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,825
How do we know you have him?

126
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,918
Now, if you want to save...

127
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,587
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

128
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,592
Sleep well.

129
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:11,703
She's a fine woman, your sister.

130
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,874
I look forward to having
her back in my bed.

131
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:20,813
And you're all fine-looking men.

132
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,048
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

133
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:26,319
I haven't fed them for
seven days. They're ravenous.

134
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,321
I wonder which parts they'll try first.

135
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:31,824
Your eyes?

136
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:33,392
Your balls?

137
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:37,997
We'll find out soon enough.

138
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:42,434
In the morning, then, bastard.

139
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,620
If he was smart, he'd stay inside

140
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,488
the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

141
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,525
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

142
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:09,461
If the other houses sense
weakness on his part,

143
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,297
they'll stop fearing him.

144
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:14,066
He can't have that. Fear is his power.

145
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:16,735
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

146
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:19,438
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

147
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,874
It's not his men that worry me.

148
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:23,309
It's his horses.

149
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,577
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

150
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,780
You and Stannis cut through
us like piss through snow.

151
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:31,116
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

152
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,452
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

153
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:34,854
in a double envelopment.

154
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,726
A pincer move.

155
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,133
They won't be able to
hit us from the sides.

156
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:50,135
Good.

157
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,374
It's crucial that we
let them charge at us.

158
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:59,378
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

159
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:05,217
If we let him buckle our
center, he'll pursue.

160
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,820
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

161
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:12,691
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

162
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,327
No.

163
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,329
But I wanted to make him angry.

164
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,368
I want him coming at us full tilt.

165
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,105
We should all get some sleep.

166
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:30,042
Rest, Jon Snow. We need
you sharp tomorrow.

167
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:42,854
So you've met the enemy,

168
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:46,358
drawn up your battle plans.

169
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,395
Aye, for what they're worth.

170
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:53,365
You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

171
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,267
you and your trusted advisors,

172
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,936
and you sit around making your plans

173
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,905
on how to defeat a man you don't know.

174
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:01,540
I lived with him.

175
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:03,242
I know the way his mind works.

176
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:06,445
I know how he likes to hurt people.

177
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:10,782
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

178
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,886
You're right.

179
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:17,656
You think he's going to
fall into your trap.

180
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:20,025
He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

181
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,928
- He's overconfident.
- He plays with people.

182
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,664
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

183
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,567
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

184
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,471
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

185
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:35,341
I've defended the Wall from
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

186
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,977
You don't know him.

187
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,213
All right, tell me.

188
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:44,149
What should we do? How
do we get Rickon back?

189
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,853
We'll never get him back.

190
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,291
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

191
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,093
which makes him a greater
threat to Ramsay

192
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:57,262
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

193
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:00,332
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

194
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,902
which means he won't live long.

195
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,372
We can't give up on our brother.

196
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:09,574
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

197
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:12,711
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

198
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,913
I don't know! I don't know
anything about battles.

199
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,384
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

200
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:19,718
Aye, that's good advice.

201
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,186
You think that's obvious?

202
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,654
Well, it is a bit obvious.

203
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,023
If you had asked for my advice earlier,

204
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,790
I would have told you not
to attack Winterfell

205
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:28,193
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

206
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,595
When will we have a larger force?!

207
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:32,731
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

208
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,099
The Blackfish can't help us.

209
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,135
We're lucky to have this many men.

210
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:39,738
- It's not enough! - No, it's
not enough. It's what we have!

211
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:48,080
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

212
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:56,321
If Ramsay wins,

213
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:58,323
I'm not going back there alive.

214
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,092
Do you understand me?

215
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:06,598
I won't let ever let
him touch you again.

216
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:11,603
I'll protect you, I promise.

217
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,340
No one can protect me.

218
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:17,342
No one can protect anyone.

219
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:38,097
You think there's hope?

220
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,532
I've never seen these
Bolton fuckers fight.

221
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,968
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

222
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,070
so, yes, there's hope.

223
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:50,775
You want to avenge your king, don't you?

224
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:53,712
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.

225
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:56,281
It was Stannis himself.

226
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,049
I loved the man.

227
00:20:58,152 --> 00:21:00,552
He lifted me up and made me something.

228
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:03,788
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

229
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,492
- You saw these demons?
- What?

230
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,961
No, it's a manner of speaking.

231
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,766
Not... actual demons.

232
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:19,238
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis

233
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,473
and I loved the man he burned.

234
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,609
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

235
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,212
He didn't torch people or
listen to some red witch.

236
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:29,681
I believed in him.

237
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:33,718
I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

238
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,087
But I was wrong just like you.

239
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:41,160
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

240
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:45,297
Jon Snow's not a king.

241
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,833
No, he's not.

242
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:55,974
I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.

243
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,543
You want some?

244
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,045
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

245
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,080
stronger than any of that grape water

246
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:04,349
you southern twats like sucking on.

247
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:06,285
No, thanks. It does sound delicious,

248
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:08,987
but I better keep a clear head.

249
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:11,423
I can never sleep the
night before a battle.

250
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,192
So what do you do all night?

251
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:15,494
I walk.

252
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,329
Think and walk.

253
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:19,565
Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

254
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,766
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

255
00:22:23,904 --> 00:22:25,837
Happy shitting.

256
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,185
My lady.

257
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,092
You weren't at the war council.

258
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:50,529
I'm not a soldier.

259
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:53,965
Any advice?

260
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,368
Don't lose.

261
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:04,243
If I do, if I fall...

262
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:09,281
don't bring me back.

263
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:11,316
I'll have to try.

264
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,518
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

265
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:15,287
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

266
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:17,656
You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

267
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:20,425
I serve the Lord of Light.

268
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,794
I do what he commands.

269
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:24,296
How do you know what he commands?

270
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,033
I interpret his signs...

271
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:31,303
as well as I can.

272
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:36,207
If the Lord didn't want
me to bring you back,

273
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,877
how did I bring you back?

274
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,513
I have no power.

275
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:44,983
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

276
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:48,620
Why?

277
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:50,889
I don't know.

278
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:59,998
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

279
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,101
Maybe he brought you here to die again.

280
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:10,342
What kind of god would
do something like that?

281
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,413
The one we've got.

282
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:32,632
Game of Thrones 6x09 - The Battle of Bastards.

283
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:07,426
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

284
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:13,765
You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

285
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:18,102
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

286
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:22,040
thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

287
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:25,444
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

288
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:27,378
"someone to look up to."

289
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,782
You're all making the
same five or six jokes.

290
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:34,152
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

291
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:37,522
And how have things been
going for you since then?

292
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:40,425
Not so well, I gather.

293
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:44,464
Can't imagine you would have murdered the
Stark boys if things had been going well.

294
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:46,064
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

295
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,033
But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

296
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:50,335
And he paid for them.

297
00:26:50,437 --> 00:26:52,403
Doesn't seem like it.

298
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:54,339
He's still alive.

299
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,407
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,

300
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,677
growing up at Winterfell.

301
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:01,947
Never quite knowing who you were.

302
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:05,617
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

303
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,652
You've brought us 100
ships from the Iron Fleet

304
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:09,387
with men to sail them.

305
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,690
In return, I expect you
want me to support

306
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:14,225
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

307
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:17,017
Not my claim. Hers.

308
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:18,329
And what's wrong with you?

309
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:19,931
I'm not fit to rule.

310
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:21,600
We can agree upon that at least.

311
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:24,302
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

312
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:25,971
No more than Westeros.

313
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:31,109
Our Uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

314
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:34,679
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

315
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:37,348
He would have murdered
us if we'd stayed.

316
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:41,887
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

317
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,122
You and I have that in common.

318
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:46,892
We do.

319
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:49,327
And both murdered by a usurper as well.

320
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:52,230
Will their ships be enough?

321
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:55,400
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

322
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:57,536
Barely.

323
00:27:57,638 --> 00:28:00,304
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

324
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:02,807
There are and Euron is building more.

325
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,543
He's going to offer them to you.

326
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:06,077
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

327
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,713
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

328
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,916
He also wants to give you...

329
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:14,653
His big cock, I think he said.

330
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:17,989
Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.

331
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:19,891
You won't get one without the other.

332
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:22,493
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

333
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:25,897
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

334
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:30,401
He murdered our father and
would have murdered us.

335
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,071
He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.

336
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:34,839
The Seven Kingdoms.

337
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:36,107
All of them.

338
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:37,909
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

339
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:41,279
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

340
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:43,848
We ask you to give them back.

341
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,216
And that's all?

342
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:47,886
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

343
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:49,854
who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

344
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,590
Reasonable.

345
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:56,494
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

346
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,597
She's not demanding, she's asking.

347
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,466
The others are free to ask as well.

348
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:08,707
Our fathers were evil
men, all of us here.

349
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,242
They left the world worse
than they found it.

350
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:12,944
We're not going to do that.

351
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:16,047
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

352
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:21,586
You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

353
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:24,990
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

354
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:29,628
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

355
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,430
That's our way of life.

356
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,065
No more.

357
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:43,341
No more.

358
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:30,501
Do you like games, little man?

359
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:32,670
Let's play a game.

360
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,009
Run to your brother.

361
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,944
The sooner you make it to him,

362
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:42,413
the sooner you get to see him again.

363
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:46,550
That's it.

364
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,786
That's the game.

365
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,788
Easy.

366
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:52,790
Ready?

367
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,358
Go.

368
00:33:58,164 --> 00:34:01,132
No, you have to run, remember?

369
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:03,368
Those are the rules.

370
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:09,200
`T`U`S`U`B`T`I`T`U`L`O`C`O`M

371
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,421
Don't.

372
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,533
Prepare to charge.

373
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:19,003
Prepare to charge!

374
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,341
- Draw!
- Draw!

375
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:25,510
Draw!

376
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:27,078
Loose!

377
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:36,954
Go! Go! Follow your commander!

378
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:43,894
Run and fight!

379
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:14,725
Nock!

380
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:17,195
- Draw!
- Draw!

381
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:18,963
- Loose!
- Loose!

382
00:37:28,774 --> 00:37:29,640
Now.

383
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:34,078
Cavalry, charge!

384
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,767
- Nock!
- Nock!

385
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:32,370
- Nock!
- Nock!

386
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,040
- Draw!
- Draw!

387
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:38,909
- Draw!
- Draw!

388
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:44,114
We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.

389
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,984
- Loose!
- Loose!

390
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:29,093
Get word...

391
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,219
No!

392
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,463
Loose!

393
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,113
- Loose!
- Loose!

394
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,757
- Loose!
- Loose!

395
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:05,022
We may as well be
taking shits back here.

396
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:08,326
Follow!

397
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,967
It's time, go.

398
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,472
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

399
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:24,274
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

400
00:41:24,377 --> 00:41:25,909
Show me!

401
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,907
Hey!

402
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:58,135
Infantry, advance!

403
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:33,003
With me, lads! Break their line!

404
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:08,005
Help me!

405
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,301
- Tormund!
- Get him back!

406
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:41,104
Infantry, advance.

407
00:44:46,378 --> 00:44:48,779
Both sides!

408
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:50,714
Fall back!

409
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:53,918
Fall back!

410
00:45:14,306 --> 00:45:16,306
Fuck this, come on!

411
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:28,318
We're going home!

412
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:46,810
Open the gate!

413
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,017
Archers to the wall.

414
00:49:55,988 --> 00:49:58,255
- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

415
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:01,458
We have Winterfell.

416
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,994
They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

417
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:05,896
Archers!

418
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:07,697
To the wall!

419
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,761
You suggested one-on-one
combat, didn't you?

420
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:54,972
I've reconsidered.

421
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:58,541
I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

422
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:01,064
We're going to bury my
brother in the crypt

423
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,266
next to my father.

424
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:10,673
Jon.

425
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:18,448
Where is he?

426
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,979
Sansa.

427
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:55,652
Hello, Sansa.

428
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:05,662
Is this where I'll be staying now?

429
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:16,072
No.

430
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:23,647
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

431
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:28,985
That's all right.

432
00:55:29,087 --> 00:55:30,920
You can't kill me.

433
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:34,691
I'm part of you now.

434
00:55:37,496 --> 00:55:39,762
Your words will disappear.

435
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,235
Your house will disappear.

436
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:48,505
Your name will disappear.

437
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:53,076
All memory of you will disappear.

438
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:22,805
My hounds will never harm me.

439
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:25,342
You haven't fed them in seven days.

440
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:26,909
You said it yourself.

441
00:56:31,149 --> 00:56:32,749
They're loyal beasts.

442
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:34,684
They were.

443
00:56:34,786 --> 00:56:36,653
Now they're starving.

444
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:02,545
Sit.

445
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:04,080
Down.

446
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:06,783
Down!

447
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:10,052
Down! Down!

448
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,088
Down!

449
00:57:48,854 --> 00:59:13,674
