Easy.

What do you remember?

14
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,340
They stabbed me.

15
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:28,630
Olly...

16
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,884
he put a knife
in my heart.

17
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,109
I shouldn't be here.

18
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:45,397
The lady
brought you back.

19
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:49,234
Afterwards,
after they stabbed you,

20
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,486
after you died,
where did you go?

21
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,538
What did you see?

22
00:03:57,995 --> 00:03:59,795
Nothing.

23
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,549
There was nothing
at all.

24
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,640
The Lord let you
come back for a reason.

25
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:16,228
Stannis was not the prince
who was promised,

26
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:17,929
but someone has to be.

27
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,653
Could you give us
a moment?

28
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,759
You were dead.

29
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:49,544
And now you're not.

30
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:54,883
That's completely
fucking mad, seems to me.

31
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:57,435
I can only imagine
how it seems to you.

32
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,107
I did what
I thought was right.

33
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:06,228
And I got
murdered for it.

34
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:09,564
And now I'm back.

35
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,066
Why?

36
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,784
I don't know.

37
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:15,287
Maybe we'll never know.

38
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,372
What does it matter?

39
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,126
You go on.

40
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:25,413
You fight for as long
as you can.

41
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,416
You clean up as much
of the shit as you can.

42
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:31,469
I don't know
how to do that.

43
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:35,223
I thought I did, but...

44
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:41,012
I failed.

45
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,067
Good.

46
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:47,652
Now go fail again.

47
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,028
<i>( door opens )</i>

48
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:46,411
They think
you're some kind of god.

49
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:49,331
The man who returned
from the dead.

50
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,999
I'm not a god.

51
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:53,802
I know that.

52
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,305
I saw your pecker.

53
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,308
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

54
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:03,561
( both chuckle )

55
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,730
( winces )

56
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,778
( winces )

57
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:28,620
Your eyes
are still brown.

58
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:30,505
Is that still
you in there?

59
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,507
I think so.

60
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:37,712
Hold off on burning
my body for now.

61
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,964
( laughs )

62
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,217
That's funny.

63
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,104
You sure that's still
you in there?

64
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,223
( laughs )

65
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:50,809

- ( chatter )
- ( Sam groans )

67
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,554
You all right?

68
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,257
Yes.
Yes, I'm fine.

69
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:29,064
Did I ever tell you I used to think
the sea was called the see

70
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:32,100
because it was nothing but
water as far as the eye could see?

71
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:33,485
I don't think so.

72
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:35,987
Sea, see.

73
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:38,907
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

74
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,993
Yeah, they do.

75
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:45,080
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

76
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:51,336
Sam, are you
going to be sick?

77
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:08,803
Won't be long.
We'll be in the south soon.

78
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,972
I'm excited
to see Oldtown.

79
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:16,561
Captain says it's the most beautiful
city in Westeros.

80
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,064
Are you going
to vomit again?

81
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,367
No.
No, no, no.

82
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,654
The Citadel
doesn't admit women.

83
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,824
There won't be a place for you there
or for Little Sam.

84
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,378
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

85
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:35,547
The Citadel
isn't Castle Black.

86
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:39,050
I don't have a Jon Snow
or Maester Aemon

87
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:41,970
to help me
bend the rules.

88
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,888
I'll stay
in Oldtown, then.

89
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,673
By yourself?

90
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,475
With a baby
and no money?

91
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,845
So if we're not
going to Oldtown,

92
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,096
where are you
taking me?

93
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:55,850
To my home.

94
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,185
Horn Hill.

95
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:01,773
My father's--
well, my father,

96
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,443
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

97
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:08,246
They'll take care
of you both.

98
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,616
"Wherever you go,
I go, too."

99
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,451
<i>That's what you said.</i>

100
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:33,104
I said that because I want
you and Little Sam to be safe.

101
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:35,473
That's all I want--

102
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,110
to become a maester
so I can help Jon when the time comes

103
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,862
so you'll be safe.

104
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,564
Us and everyone else
in the world.

105
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,782
I don't care about them.

106
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:48,786
Well, no, I do,
but I don't really.

107
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,290
I care about
you and him.

108
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,744
I know that, Sam.

109
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,080
And he does, too.

110
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:04,385
You're the only one
who ever has.

111
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:15,597
If you think
it's for the best,

112
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:18,316
we trust you.

113
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:21,319
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

114
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,906
I'd never do that
to the father of my son.

115
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,919
( coughs )

116
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:41,172

117
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,382
<i>( distant horse whinnies )</i>

118
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:17,208
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

119
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,999
That's my father.

120
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,502
The man beside him
is Howland Reed,

121
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,137
Meera's father.

122
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,684
Ser Arthur Dayne.

123
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,902
The Sword
of the Morning.

124
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:47,772
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

125
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,921
Lord Stark.

126
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,208
I looked for you
on the Trident.

127
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:09,293
We weren't there.

128
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,962
Your friend the usurper

129
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:14,048
would lie beneath the ground
if we had been.

130
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:16,184
The Mad King is dead.

131
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,353
Rhaegar lies
beneath the ground.

132
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,855
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

133
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,857
Our prince
wanted us here.

134
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,233
Where's my sister?

135
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:37,538
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

136
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:46,998
And now it begins.

137
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:53,588
No.

138
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:55,640
Now it ends.

139
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:01,813
( shouts )

140
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,182
( groans )

141
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,105
( shouts )

142
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:19,614
( gurgles )

143
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,075
( groans )

144
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,856
He's better
than my father.

145
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:36,491
Far better.

146
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,531
But Father beat hi

147
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,700
Did he?

148
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,785
I know he did.

149
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,537
Heard the story
a thousand times.

150
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:00,214
( grunts )

151
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,473
He stabbed him
in the back.

152
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,625
<i>( woman screams )</i>

153
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:30,244
What's in the tower?

154
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,046
That's enough
for one day.

155
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:33,831
We'll visit again
another time.

156
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,500
- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

157
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,969
<i>( screaming continues )</i>

158
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,253
Father!

159
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:02,660
( gasps )

160
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:07,365
Why did you do that?

161
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,533
Take me back there.
I want to go back.

162
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,918
No.

163
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:15,506
- He heard me.
- Maybe.

164
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,926
- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

165
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:22,013
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,432
What's in that tower?

167
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:25,850
<i>I want to go back there.</i>

168
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:28,719
I've told you many times,
stay too long

169
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:31,272
where you don't belong
and you will never return.

170
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:33,140
Why do I want to return?

171
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,026
So I can be
a cripple again?

172
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,561
<i>So I can talk</i>
<i>to an old man in a tree?</i>

173
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,697
You think I wanted to sit here
for 1,000 years

174
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:41,649
watching the world
from a distance

175
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:43,150
as the roots
grew through me?

176
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,952
So why did you?

177
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:47,822
I was waiting for you.

178
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,707
I don't want to be you.

179
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:52,460
( laughs )
I don't blame you.

180
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:55,997
You won't
be here forever.

181
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,716
You won't be
an old man in a tree.

182
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:01,252
<i>But before you leave,</i>

183
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:04,338
you must learn.

184
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:06,257
Learn what?

185
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,976
Everything.

186
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,513
( chatter )

187
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:33,534
( speaking Dothraki )

188
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:05,462
I don't know how you stand it
in all that leather.

189
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:14,555
If we could
have the room.

190
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:27,685
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

191
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,156
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

192
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:33,440
If you're going
to torture me,

193
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,609
just call them back
and get on with it.

194
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,778
I am not a torturer.

195
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:42,666
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

196
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:46,620
And it does
provide answers.

197
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:49,590
But they're usually
the wrong answers.

198
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:53,177
My job is to find
the right answers.

199
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:55,379
Do you know
how I do that?

200
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:58,766
I do it by making
people happy.

201
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:01,468
I'd like to make
you happy, Vala.

202
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:04,805
That's your name,
isn't it, Vala?

203
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,191
( chuckles )
That's all right.

204
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,444
I know who you are
and what you've done.

205
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:13,614
You've done a lot.

206
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,150
You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

207
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:19,620
which is more
than most people do.

208
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,823
And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

209
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:25,659
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

210
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:29,129
The Unsullied and the Second Sons
are foreign soldiers

211
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:31,248
brought here
by a foreign queen

212
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:34,051
to destroy our city
and our history.

213
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,004
I understand.

214
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:39,757
Well, that makes
perfect sense

215
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,593
from your perspective.

216
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:46,480
I have a different
perspective, of course.

217
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:50,017
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

218
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:52,519
just as I will try
to see them from yours.

219
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,822
Because that
is the only way

220
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:57,825
that I can make
you and Dom happy.

221
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:04,698
That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

222
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,835
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

223
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:11,255
Such a handsome boy.

224
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:14,875
Those big, brown eyes.
Good luck keeping the ladies away.

225
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:19,129
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

226
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:22,099
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

227
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,635
Children are blameless.

228
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,888
I have never hurt them.

229
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,307
Your boy is in
no immediate danger,

230
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:31,975
this I swear to you.

231
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:35,863
But between us, dear,

232
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:39,066
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

233
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,735
We both know the penalty
for that crime.

234
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:50,544
How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

235
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:52,663
And with his breathing
problem.

236
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:55,082
If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

237
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:57,384
So either you kill me
or they do.

238
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,004
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

239
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:04,591
There is a third
option, though.

240
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:07,895
A ship leaving
tomorrow for Pentos.

241
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,599
I've already booked passage
for a woman and her young son.

242
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:16,153
I'll even throw in a bag of silver
to help you start again.

243
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,021
Though I'm afraid
we'll have to ask

244
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:21,825
one of our leather-clad friends
back in to carry it.

245
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,610
Far too heavy for me.

246
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:26,864
The boat sails at dawn.

247
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:29,750
You need to decide now.

248
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:32,619
A new life
for you and Dom

249
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,338
or...

250
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:52,189
What should we do
while we wait?

251
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:54,108
To pass the time,
what should we do?

252
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,527
<i>What should we</i>
<i>talk about?</i>

253
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,647
You speak 19 languages.

254
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:04,067
You must occasionally
use some of them to talk about things.

255
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:07,404
You two, you spend a great deal
of time together.

256
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,657
What would you be talking about
if I weren't here?

257
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,710
Patrol.

258
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:16,463
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

259
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,133
What we see on patrol.

260
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:21,168
Who we captured on patrol.

261
00:26:21,253 --> 00:26:23,720
That's good.
That's very good.

262
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:28,225
But that's a report.

263
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:30,511
I was thinking more
of a conversation.

264
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,680
A wise man once said
the true history of the world

265
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,184
is the history of great conversations
in elegant rooms.

266
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,186
Who said this?

267
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:41,655
Me.

268
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,690
Just now.

269
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:52,282
All right,
no conversations.

270
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:54,251
Let's play a game.

271
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:58,922
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

272
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,207
Games are for children.

273
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:01,959
Missandei:
<i>My master Kraznys</i>

274
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:04,211
would sometimes
make us play games.

275
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:06,046
There, that's a start.

276
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:09,850
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

277
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,885
Not that.
Of course not that.

278
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:15,522
Innocent games.
Fun games.

279
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:17,107
Drinking games.

280
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,393
Missandei:
<i>We do not drink.</i>

281
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:21,528
Until you do.

282
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:25,399
All right.
No drinking.

283
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,034
We can play
without drinking.

284
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,286
It's a wonderful game.
I invented it.

285
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:30,904
Here's how it works.

286
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,956
I make a statement
about your past.

287
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:34,708
If I'm wrong,
I drink.

288
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:37,911
And if I'm right--

289
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:41,415
maybe we can't play
without drinking.

290
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,083
<i>( door opens )</i>

291
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:45,636
Oh, you took your time.

292
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:47,721
Sorry.

293
00:27:47,806 --> 00:27:51,425
I was busy learning
who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

294
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,594
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

295
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,812
The Good Masters
of Astapor

296
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:58,098
and the Wise Masters
of Yunkai.

297
00:27:58,183 --> 00:28:01,184
With help from their friends
in Volantis.

298
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,736
Tyrion:
<i>You see?</i>

299
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:05,322
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

300
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,940
We only have
to worry about

301
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,276
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

302
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:10,994
We conquered Astapor
and Yunkai once.

303
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:12,946
We will do it again
and execute the Masters.

304
00:28:13,032 --> 00:28:16,450
If the Unsullied march off to reconquer
Astapor and Yunkai,

305
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:18,035
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

306
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,671
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

307
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,456
We cannot.

308
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:25,342
The Masters speak
only one language.

309
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,127
They spoke it to me
for many years.

310
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:28,962
<i>I know it better</i>
<i>than my mother tongue.</i>

311
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:32,766
If we want them to hear us,
we must speak it back to them.

312
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:35,018
May it be the last thing
they ever hear.

313
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:37,187
You may be right.

314
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:39,273
Grey Worm:
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

315
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:41,308
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

316
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:44,311
It's a conversation.

317
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:46,697
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

318
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:50,033
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

319
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:52,703
and benevolent
enslavers of Volantis?

320
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:55,455
Of course.
Men can be fickle,

321
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,659
but birds
I always trust.

322
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:01,078
( children chatting quietly )

323
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,884
Your eye looks
much better, Arthur.

324
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:09,336
How's your mother's jaw?

325
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:10,971
Better.

326
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,389
And your father?

327
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:14,975
No one's seen him.

328
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,343
And no one will.

329
00:29:16,428 --> 00:29:18,061
That worked out
rather nicely.

330
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,180
Will Lord Varys
ever come back?

331
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:22,349
I don't think so.

332
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:24,267
Do you miss him?

333
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:26,937
He was nice.

334
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:29,356
He called us
his little birds.

335
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:31,024
He gave us sweets.

336
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:35,996
It's funny you should
mention that.

337
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,702
Guess what I happened
to find today.

338
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:45,372
Candied plums
from Dorne.

339
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,842
( laughing )

340
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:51,044
Now remember,
if any of your friends

341
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,381
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

342
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:58,885
All I need in return
are whispers.

343
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:01,271
<i>( door opens )</i>

344
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:08,145
Qyburn:
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

345
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,147
This is Ser Gregor.

346
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,482
He's friends
with all my friends.

347
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:20,040
Run along now.

348
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:26,713
Varys's little birds?

349
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,298
Your little birds now,
Your Grace.

350
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,333
What did you do
to him exactly?

351
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,085
I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

352
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:34,254
Oh, a number of things.

353
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,839
Does he understand
what we're saying?

354
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:38,175
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

355
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,510
complete sentences
in the first place.

356
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,398
He understands
well enough.

357
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:46,516
So tell him to march
into the Sept

358
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:49,236
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

359
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:52,739
The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith
Militant surrounding him.

360
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:55,108
Ser Gregor
can't face them all.

361
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:57,110
And he won't have to.

362
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:59,246
He'll only have
to face one.

363
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,784
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

364
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:05,535
Not yet.

365
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:08,789
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

366
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:10,791
Don't stop at the city.

367
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:13,210
I want little birds
in Dorne,

368
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:15,962
in Highgarden,
in the North.

369
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:19,132
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

370
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:21,101
I want to hear it.

371
00:31:21,186 --> 00:31:23,804
If someone is laughing
at the queen

372
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:26,523
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

373
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:28,391
I want to hear.

374
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:31,278
I want to know
who they are.

375
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:33,480
I want to know
where they are.

376
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:42,706
Pycelle: <i>As bad as Lord Varys was,</i>
<i>Qyburn is worse.</i>

377
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:45,208
I told them all.
I told them.

378
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:47,210
He's arrogant,
dangerous.

379
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:50,330
You don't get thrown out of the Citadel
without good reason.

380
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:52,165
- And no one listened to my advice.
-<i> ( door opens )</i>

381
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,384
<i>So here we are.</i>

382
00:31:54,503 --> 00:31:56,803
And what he's done
to Gregor Clegane

383
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:58,839
<i>is an abomination.</i>

384
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:02,008
We never sanctioned
this experiment.

385
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:04,678
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

386
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:06,480
to have the beast dest--

387
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:11,234
<i>( farts )</i>

388
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:13,854
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

389
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:16,356
- My mother--
- I was invited, my dear,

390
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:19,109
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

391
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:21,528
such as the queen's
imprisonment.

392
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:24,030
Thank you
for bringing it up.

393
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,868
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

394
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:30,170
Margaery is the queen.

395
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:32,038
You are not the queen

396
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,174
<i>because you're not</i>
<i>married to the king.</i>

397
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,959
I do appreciate
these things

398
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:39,679
can get a bit confusing
in your family.

399
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:41,932
This is a small
council meeting.

400
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,184
You have no position
on the small council.

401
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,052
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

402
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,554
The Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard

403
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:49,389
does have a position
on the small council.

404
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,058
Grand Maester Pycelle,
would you sanction that statement?

405
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,227
Well, um...

406
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:57,314
I would say
Ser Gerold Hightower

407
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,482
had a seat on
the Mad King's council.

408
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:02,152
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>that was the Mad King.</i>

409
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:03,870
King Robert saw
things differently.

410
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:05,655
- And King--
- ( loud thud )

411
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:11,795
What about
Myrcella's death, Uncle?

412
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:14,080
Do you consider the murder
of your own blood

413
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,166
a troublesome issue?

414
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,084
The same women
who murdered Myrcella

415
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,670
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

416
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:22,472
We've got a lot
to discuss.

417
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:24,975
All of us together.

418
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:28,762
And seeing as you cannot make us leave,
we best get on with it.

419
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:33,433
No, we cannot
make you leave.

420
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,653
And you cannot
make us stay.

421
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:40,357
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

422
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:08,551
-<i> ( door opens )</i>
-<i> ( armor rattling )</i>

423
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,566
( groans )
Your Grace.

424
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:26,820
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

425
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:29,489
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

426
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,491
That's not possible.
Not yet.

427
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:33,243
When will it
be possible?

428
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:35,662
When she's fully atoned
for her sins.

429
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:38,331
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

430
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,834
through the streets
in front of the whole city.

431
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,636
That wasn't
the full atonement?

432
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,504
No.

433
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:47,724
She must stand trial
before seven septons

434
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:49,976
so we can learn
the true extent of her sins.

435
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:54,230
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

436
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:55,899
I am the king.

437
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:57,484
You are.

438
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,354
And what does that
mean to you?

439
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,856
<i>It means</i>
<i>a great deal to me.</i>

440
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:04,858
The Crown and the Faith

441
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:07,077
are the twin pillars
of the world.

442
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,195
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>who told me that?</i>

443
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,915
Your mother.

444
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:14,534
My mother
who is unclean?

445
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:18,588
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

446
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:40,610
How do you think the Mother Above
first came to us?

447
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:43,396
How did men and women

448
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:46,983
first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

449
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:50,203
It was through
their own mothers.

450
00:35:52,908 --> 00:35:56,292
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

451
00:35:56,411 --> 00:36:00,580
But when she speaks of you,
the Mother's love outshines it all.

452
00:36:02,634 --> 00:36:05,585
Her love for you
is more real

453
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,587
than anything else
in this world

454
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:10,673
because it doesn't
come from this world.

455
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,726
But you know that.

456
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:15,428
You've felt it.

457
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:17,731
You've seen her
when she talks to you.

458
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:21,601
Yes.

459
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:23,903
<i>It's a great gift.</i>

460
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,989
One I never had.

461
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,609
Envy.

462
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:32,162
One more thing
for me to atone for.

463
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:35,498
Your Grace,
do you-- may I?

464
00:36:35,617 --> 00:36:37,167
Do you mind?

465
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,618
It's my knees.

466
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:40,587
Of course.

467
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:49,796
When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

468
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:52,132
she did it
to get back to you.

469
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:54,968
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

470
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:56,853
through any more than
she's already endured.

471
00:36:56,972 --> 00:37:00,306
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

472
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:03,026
<i>They make their will known</i>
<i>to us and it's up to us</i>

473
00:37:03,145 --> 00:37:05,562
to either accept
or reject it.

474
00:37:07,649 --> 00:37:09,315
Please.

475
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:17,874
If we're to be
just and good,

476
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:20,710
then we accept it,
all of us, even kings.

477
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:25,081
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

478
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,634
And no one is wiser
than the gods.

479
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:33,339
My grandfather once said
something similar.

480
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:35,308
Except for the part
about the gods.

481
00:37:35,393 --> 00:37:39,312
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

482
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,599
As they work
through your mother.

483
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:46,903
There's so much good
in all of us.

484
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:50,690
The best we can do
is to help each other bring it out.

485
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:07,624
( gasps )

486
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:12,795
( gasps )

487
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:20,720
Who are you?

488
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:22,222
No one.

489
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:24,023
( grunts )

490
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:26,609
Waif: <i>Who were you</i>
<i>before you came here?</i>

491
00:38:26,728 --> 00:38:28,361
Arya:
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

492
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:30,230
( grunts )

493
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:32,899
Waif: <i>Tell me about</i>
<i>Arya Stark's family.</i>

494
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,902
Her father
was Eddard Stark.

495
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:38,538
Her mother
was Catelyn Stark.

496
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:41,958
She had one sister,
Sansa,

497
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:43,960
and four brothers.

498
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,633
( panting )

499
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:55,421
Three brothers.

500
00:38:55,557 --> 00:38:58,341
<i>Robb, Bran,</i>
<i>Rickon.</i>

501
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:03,229
And a half-brother Jon.

502
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:06,733
And where are they now?

503
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:09,769
Arya: <i>They may be dead</i>
<i>for all a girl knows.</i>

504
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,856
( sniffs )

505
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:19,946
( sniffs )

506
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:21,497
Tell me about the Hound.

507
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:25,118
Arya:
<i>Also dead.</i>

508
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:38,514
<i>Arya Stark left him to die.</i>
<i>He was on her list.</i>

509
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:44,103
He was not
on her list anymore.

510
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:45,939
She had taken him
off it.

511
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:50,109
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

512
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:56,199
Arya:
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

513
00:39:59,704 --> 00:40:02,822
She sounds confused.

514
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:11,331
Yes, she was.

515
00:40:15,553 --> 00:40:18,304
Who else was on
Arya Stark's funny little list?

516
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,391
- ( groans )
- Arya: <i>Cersei Lannister.</i>

517
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,143
<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

518
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,480
<i>Walder Frey.</i>

519
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,399
<i>( rustling )</i>

520
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:33,987
Waif:
<i>That's a short list.</i>

521
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:36,072
( panting )

522
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:40,493
<i>That can't be everyone</i>
<i>you want to kill.</i>

523
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,782
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

524
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:51,871
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

525
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:03,132
( shouts )

526
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:29,959
Jaqen: <i>If a girl</i>
<i>tells me her name,</i>

527
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:32,462
I will give
her eyes back.

528
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,383
A girl has no name.

529
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:42,089
Come.

530
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:17,790
If a girl
is truly no one,

531
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,293
<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

532
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,787
Who are you?

533
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:53,042
No one.

534
00:42:56,581 --> 00:42:58,381
( horse whinnies )

535
00:43:02,637 --> 00:43:05,755
The Umbers are
a famously loyal house.

536
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,341
Famously loyal
to the Starks.

537
00:43:08,426 --> 00:43:11,477
And you, Lord Karstark.

538
00:43:11,563 --> 00:43:14,347
Your people share
blood with the Starks, don't they?

539
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:17,099
But here we are.
Times change.

540
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:19,519
When my father became
Warden of the North,

541
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:21,604
<i>your house refused</i>
<i>to pledge their banners.</i>

542
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:23,489
Your father was a cunt.

543
00:43:26,694 --> 00:43:28,911
My beloved father,
the Warden--

544
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,165
Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

545
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,084
<i>I might have done</i>
<i>the same to my father</i>

546
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:37,753
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

547
00:43:37,872 --> 00:43:40,673
My father was poisoned
by our enemies.

548
00:43:40,758 --> 00:43:42,508
Mmm.

549
00:43:42,594 --> 00:43:45,878
Why have you come
to Winterfell, Lord Umber?

550
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:49,849
The bastard Jon Snow
led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

551
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:52,351
We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

552
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:55,721
<i>Wildlings come down,</i>
<i>we always have to fight them first.</i>

553
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:59,058
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

554
00:43:59,143 --> 00:44:01,894
But there are too many of them for us
to beat back alone.

555
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,864
So now you've come
seeking help?

556
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,283
We need to help
each other.

557
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:10,953
The colder it gets, the farther south
those goat fuckers will roam.

558
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:13,039
Won't take them long
to get here.

559
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:15,958
You think a horde
of wildlings can take Winterfell?

560
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:17,677
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

561
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:20,213
<i>He knows this place</i>
<i>better than we ever will.</i>

562
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:25,468
Pledge your banners
to House Bolton.

563
00:44:25,587 --> 00:44:28,087
Swear loyalty to me
as Warden of the North

564
00:44:28,223 --> 00:44:30,723
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

565
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:32,308
and all his
wildling friends.

566
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:34,594
I'm not kissing
your fucking hand.

567
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:37,313
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

568
00:44:37,432 --> 00:44:39,432
I'm not doing that either.

569
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:42,485
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

570
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:45,438
Your father
honored tradition.

571
00:44:45,523 --> 00:44:47,740
<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

572
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:50,243
Called him
King of the North.

573
00:44:50,328 --> 00:44:52,495
<i>Was Robb Stark right</i>
<i>to trust your father?</i>

574
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:54,413
Then it appears
we're at a bit of an impasse.

575
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:57,617
Fuck kneeling
and fuck oaths.

576
00:44:57,752 --> 00:44:59,335
I've got a gift for you.

577
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,041
A girl, I hope.
I prefer redheads.

578
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:08,127
A girl, aye.

579
00:45:08,212 --> 00:45:09,378
( laughing )

580
00:45:09,464 --> 00:45:11,514
<i>A wild one.</i>

581
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,023
I like them wild.

582
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,611
And the boy,
nice and young.

583
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:27,863
The way Karstark
likes them.

584
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:35,154
Who's this?

585
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:37,623
Rickon Stark.

586
00:45:44,716 --> 00:45:46,999
How do I know
that's Rickon Stark?

587
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:20,533
Welcome home,
Lord Stark.

588
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:26,622
<i>( pounding on door )</i>

589
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:33,763
It's time.

590
00:47:11,169 --> 00:47:14,253
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

591
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,639
You shouldn't
be alive.

592
00:47:16,758 --> 00:47:18,674
It's not right.

593
00:47:19,844 --> 00:47:21,644
Neither was killing me.

594
00:47:25,983 --> 00:47:28,601
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

595
00:47:28,736 --> 00:47:30,603
Could you write her?

596
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:33,022
Tell her I died
fighting the wildlings.

597
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:45,167
I had a choice,
Lord Commander.

598
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:49,255
Betray you or betray
the Night's Watch.

599
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,425
You brought an army of wildlings
into our lands.

600
00:47:54,295 --> 00:47:57,129
An army of murderers
and raiders.

601
00:47:57,265 --> 00:48:00,966
If I had to do it all over knowing
where I'd end up,

602
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:04,470
I pray I'd make
the right choice again.

603
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:06,639
I'm sure you would,
Ser Alliser.

604
00:48:06,724 --> 00:48:09,725
I fought, I lost.

605
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:13,479
Now I rest.

606
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:18,400
But you, Lord Snow,

607
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:20,903
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

608
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:24,383
( choking, gasping )

609
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:10,012
We should burn
the bodies.

610
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:13,015
You should.

611
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:24,076
What do you want me
to do with this?

612
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:25,861
Wear it.

613
00:50:25,947 --> 00:50:28,280
Burn it.

614
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:30,583
Whatever you want.

615
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:32,167
You have Castle Black.

616
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,176
My watch is ended.
