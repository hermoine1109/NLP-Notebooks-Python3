    "Doc2Vec is an NLP tool for representing documents as a vector and is a generalizing of the Word2Vec method. This tutorial will serve as an introduction to Doc2Vec and present ways to train and assess a Doc2Vec model. Insted of dealing with non correlated set of sentences (as we did in Word2Vec) , we deal with a set of correlated sentences(preferably from the same paragraph)."
